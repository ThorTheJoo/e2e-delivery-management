# SpecSync Import Column Header Rename

## Overview

This document outlines the renaming of the "Capability" column header to "Function" in the SpecSync Import preview panel table.

## Change Made

### Column Header Update

**File**: `src/components/specsync-import.tsx`
**Location**: Line 353-354 in the table header section
**Change**: Renamed column header from "Capability" to "Function"

#### Before
```tsx
<th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">
  Capability
</th>
```

#### After
```tsx
<th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">
  Function
</th>
```

## Context

The SpecSync Import component displays a preview table with the following columns:
- **ID**: Unique requirement identifier
- **Requirement**: Description of the requirement
- **Domain**: Associated domain
- **Function**: Previously labeled as "Capability" (now renamed)
- **Use Case**: Associated use case
- **Actions**: Action buttons and badges

## Implementation Details

### Table Structure
The change affects the table header in the "Requirements Preview (First 10) - Click to Edit" section:

```tsx
<thead>
  <tr className="bg-muted/70">
    <th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">ID</th>
    <th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">Requirement</th>
    <th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">Domain</th>
    <th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">Function</th>
    <th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">Use Case</th>
    <th className="border border-muted-foreground/20 px-2 py-1 text-left">Actions</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
```

### Data Mapping
The underlying data structure and mapping remain unchanged. The column still displays the same data (capability information), but with a more appropriate header label.

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Clarity**
- "Function" is more descriptive and user-friendly than "Capability"
- Better aligns with business terminology and user expectations
- Reduces confusion about what the column represents

### 2. **Consistent Terminology**
- Aligns with other parts of the application that may use "Function" terminology
- Provides clearer context for users reviewing imported requirements

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- More intuitive column header for end users
- Easier to understand the purpose of the data in that column

## Validation

### ✅ **No Linting Errors**
- All TypeScript and ESLint checks pass
- No syntax or formatting issues

### ✅ **Functionality Preserved**
- Table structure and data display remain intact
- All existing functionality continues to work
- No breaking changes to data processing or display

### ✅ **Styling Maintained**
- All CSS classes and styling preserved
- Table layout and appearance unchanged
- Responsive design maintained

## Usage

The SpecSync Import preview panel now displays the renamed column:

1. **Access**: Navigate to TMF tab → SpecSync Import section
2. **Import Data**: Upload a CSV file with requirements
3. **View Preview**: The table now shows "Function" instead of "Capability" as the column header
4. **Data Display**: The same capability/function data is displayed under the new header

## Technical Notes

- **Minimal Change**: Only the display text was modified
- **No Data Impact**: Underlying data structure and processing unchanged
- **Backward Compatible**: No impact on existing functionality or data
- **Future-Proof**: Change is isolated and doesn't affect other components

The column header rename has been completed successfully with no functional impact.
