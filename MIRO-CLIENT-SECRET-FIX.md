# Miro Client Secret Configuration Fix

## Problem
The Miro OAuth integration is failing with the error:
```
The ClientSecret does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The client secret configured in your application doesn't match the client secret in your Miro Developer Platform app settings.

## Solution

### Step 1: Get the Correct Client Secret

1. **Go to Miro Developer Platform**:
   - Navigate to [https://developers.miro.com/](https://developers.miro.com/)
   - Sign in to your account
   - Go to your app (Client ID: 3458764638511169275)

2. **Find the Client Secret**:
   - Go to the "App Settings" or "OAuth" section
   - Look for "Client Secret" field
   - Copy the exact value (it should be a long string of characters)

### Step 2: Update Application Configuration

1. **Open the Application**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3002`
   - Navigate to the "Miro Configuration" tab

2. **Update Client Secret**:
   - Find the "Client Secret" field
   - Clear any existing value
   - Paste the exact client secret from Miro Developer Platform
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

3. **Save Configuration**:
   - Click "Save Configuration" button
   - Verify you see a success message

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

1. **Check Configuration Status**:
   - The configuration should show as "Configured"
   - Client Secret should show as "***SET***"

2. **Test OAuth Flow**:
   - Click "Connect to Miro"
   - Complete the OAuth authorization
   - Verify successful redirect back to the application

### Step 4: Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "The ClientSecret does not exist" still appears
**Possible Causes**:
- Client secret doesn't match Miro Developer Platform
- Extra spaces or characters in the secret
- Secret was regenerated in Miro but not updated in app

**Solution**:
1. Double-check the client secret in Miro Developer Platform
2. Copy it again and paste it fresh in the application
3. Make sure there are no leading/trailing spaces
4. Save configuration and try again

#### Issue: Client secret appears as placeholder
**Solution**:
1. Clear the client secret field completely
2. Enter the real client secret from Miro Developer Platform
3. Save configuration

#### Issue: Configuration not saving
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### Step 5: Verification Commands

You can verify the configuration using these commands:

```bash
# Check server configuration
node scripts/diagnose-miro-secret.js

# Check OAuth endpoint
curl http://localhost:3002/api/auth/miro
```

### Step 6: Debug Information

Current application configuration:
- **Client ID**: 3458764638511169275
- **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3002/api/auth/miro/callback`
- **Scopes**: `boards:read`, `boards:write`
- **Client Secret**: [Must match Miro Developer Platform]

## Important Notes

1. **Security**: Never share your client secret publicly
2. **Exact Match**: The client secret must match exactly what's in Miro Developer Platform
3. **No Spaces**: Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters
4. **Case Sensitive**: Client secrets are case-sensitive

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to have issues:

1. **Regenerate Client Secret**:
   - In Miro Developer Platform, regenerate the client secret
   - Copy the new secret
   - Update the application configuration

2. **Check App Status**:
   - Ensure your Miro app is active and not suspended
   - Verify the app has the correct permissions

3. **Clear Configuration**:
   - Clear the Miro configuration in the application
   - Re-enter all values from scratch
   - Save and test again

The key is ensuring the client secret in your application exactly matches the one in your Miro Developer Platform app settings.
