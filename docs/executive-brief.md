# E2E Delivery Management — Executive Brief

Version: 1.27.1  
Date: 2025-09-13  
Audience: Executives, Business Leaders, Product Sponsors

## What It Is

E2E Delivery Management is a solution design and delivery orchestration platform that transforms raw requirements into a TMF-aligned solution model, visualizes it for stakeholders, and exports a ready-to-execute backlog to Azure DevOps.

## Why It Matters (Business Value)

- Faster, higher-confidence scoping and proposals
- Single thread of traceability from requirements → architecture → delivery
- Reduced rework via exact TMF mapping and architecture traversal
- Clear visualizations and standardized exports that stakeholders can action immediately

## What It Does (Key Capabilities)

1) Requirements Ingestion (SpecSync)
- Normalize and catalog requirements; optional Supabase export for persistence and analytics.

2) Solution Modeling (TMF)
- Map requirements to TMF domains/functions using exact matching; compute coverage and gaps.

3) Architecture Discovery (Blue Dolphin)
- Traverse relationships around target functions to uncover processes, services, interfaces, and related functions.

4) Visualization (Miro)
- Auto-create boards, frames (per domain), and cards/shapes for functions/use cases.

5) Delivery Orchestration (ADO)
- Generate Epics/Features/User Stories/Tasks and export them to ADO, validated against available work item types.

## How It Works (Flow)

Requirements → SpecSync → TMF mapping → Blue Dolphin traversal → Miro visualization → Estimation/BOM → ADO export.

## What’s Under the Hood (Stack)

- Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- Tailwind, shadcn UI, Radix UI
- Supabase (data), Miro (visual mapping), Blue Dolphin (architecture), ADO (delivery)
- CSV/XLSX processing and simple data viz

## Risk & Controls

- Strict exact matching for TMF alignment reduces ambiguity
- Server-only use of Supabase service role; dev tokens via UI for prototypes
- ADO PAT validation and minimal field set for safe work item creation
- Error-first design; structured logs and user notifications

## Outcomes & Metrics

- Time-to-scope reduction (hours/days to minutes)
- Mapping coverage (% of requirements mapped to TMF)
- ADO export success rate and remediation cycle time
- Architecture discovery completeness (object counts, types)

## Where It’s Going (Roadmap)

- End-to-end zod validation and typed error envelopes
- Server-brokered tokens (no client secrets in prod)
- Background processing for large traversals
- SSO/OIDC and role-based access
- Observability (OpenTelemetry) and error reporting (Sentry)

## How To Deploy and Operate

- Configure Supabase env vars; authenticate Miro and ADO via UI
- Validate ADO work item types; run export to a sandbox first
- Use Blue Dolphin workspace filters; tune traversal depth per workspace

## One-Slide Summary

- Input: Requirements (SpecSync)
- Map: TMF domains/functions (exact match)
- Discover: Blue Dolphin relationships
- Visualize: Miro boards/frames/cards
- Deliver: ADO-exported backlog
