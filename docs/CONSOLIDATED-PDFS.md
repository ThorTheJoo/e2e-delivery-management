Performance / Storage Capability Notice
This document details CSG’s recommended estimates for production hardware storage and performance factor values which are based upon CSG’s
assumptions and the Customer’s estimated volumes and proposed operations.
Any recommendation provided by CSG is based upon performance benchmark results of a typical configuration with synthesized data sets, and the
Customer should be aware that its system may be delivered with customizations to the configuration which may lead to different performance
characteristics. Further, if a detailed operational design review of the system is carried out by CSG, as part of a Specification Study procured by the
Customer under a duly executed Statement of Work, it may also identify business requirements which impact on the estimated sizing of the
recommended production hardware.
In the event the Customer procures CSG’s services to complete a “Hardware Composition Report” for the production hardware, CSG will not be able
to provide a production hardware performance warranty, particularly where the factor values during the actual use of the system do not conform
to the associated estimated factor values set out in the “Hardware Composition Report”. In addition, performance standards or characteristics
relating to the volume of transactions or speed of transaction handling shall not be warranted, unless such standards or characteristics are
expressly included in the Specifications for the Software, and CSG expressly agrees to such in a valid and binding agreement entered between CSG
and the Customer.

2.1 OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT <CLIENT>
Describe the Customer, who they are, what they do, and the key features of the Customer’s business
2.1.1 <CLIENT> CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
<Client> maintains <insert number> Customer segments. They are Government, Enterprise, Small/Medium
Business (SMB) and Consumer.  Although they are different in nature, <Client>’s business needs across
these segments are consistent:
• The ability to provide a unified, 360-degree view of the Customer.
• The provision of a digital, omnichannel experience to Mobily’s Customers.
• Being able to offer its Customers innovative new bundles.
• Increasing automation across the business to improve productivity and reduce errors.
• The ability to efficiently process bulk orders.
• Improving Customer satisfaction through the elimination of billing errors.
Depending on the Customer segment, the Customer buying process will align to either a shopping cart
type buying experience or a negotiated buying experience.  For <Client> the following list represents the
buying experience for each Customer segment.
• Shopping Cart Buying Experience: Consumer and SMB
• Negotiated Buying Experience: Enterprise

2.1.2 <CLIENT> PRODUCT & SERVICE SEGMENTS
Services are those products and services that <Client> offer to their Customers.  All <Client> products and
services are priced in <Currency>.
<Client> classifies their services into the following product lines:
• Mobile Products
• Fixed Products
• Digital Services
<Client>’s current product portfolio is subject to periodic changes, and the final list of product offers to be
implemented in the CSG solution will be determined during the Product Rationalization exercise.

2.1.3 PERFORMING PRODUCT RATIONALIZATION IS MISSIONCRITICAL
There is an important need to determine which products will be in scope for the <Project> and to have a
clear picture of the to-be structure for those products.  It is therefore assumed that a product
rationalization initiative will be undertaken prior to the commencement of the program.  The goals of this
initiative would be as follows:
• Reduce the number of product models that will ultimately need to be defined.
• Identify opportunities for reuse of Product, Service and Resource specifications that Product
Managers can leverage to innovate and create new products, reducing the time to market and
promoting innovation.
• Reduce the number of products that <Client> needs to manage on an ongoing basis, thus
reducing the overall cost of management.
• Determine the business priority for the sequence in which the <Project> implements new and
revised product service resource models.
After completing product rationalization, <Client> will be well positioned to initiate the broader <Project>
by reducing the discovery and planning that needs to be completed. This will help ensure that the
<Project> starts with full velocity and the overall project length is attainable.
It is important to note that Chapter X will represent the number, type and complexity of Products included
in the solution scope.  It is anticipated that the product rationalization outcomes will allow the project
team to map existing Customer’s products and services to this in-scope set of products and services.
The product rationalization exercise is described above for contextual purposes only and is deemed to be
outside the scope of this document.

2.2 OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE <PROJECT>
Describe the reason the ‘project’ they are tendering for exists.  Specifically describe the key
problems/compelling reasons/main features they want solved by the project.  The BRD should be the primary
source of this information.
Commented [CD1]: The bid team will need to include a
list of rationalised client offers in an appendix to contain
scope.
Commented [TS2]: How does this impact bill run
comparison
Commented [TS3]: It’s a pre-requisite contractual.

4.1 CONTACT/CUSTOMER/ACCOUNT DATA MODEL
4.2 DATA MODELS
Please refer to the following data models that underpin the Use Cases:
• Encompass Platform Contact Customer Balance Model
• Encompass Platform Product Model
• Encompass Platform Case Issue Action Model
• <placeholder for treatment model if we decide this is required>
 MODELLING CONTACTS (TMF632 PARTY)
Individuals and company representatives are captured as Contact entities, which serve as the primary
point of communication between the Customer and the CSP. In the Consumer/SMB segment, the Contact
and Customer may be the same person; in the Enterprise/Business segment, the Contact typically
represents the organization as its designated representative. The Contact is the primary liaison for product
inquiries, service discussions, and issue resolution.
4.1.4.1 CONTACT TYPES
When a Contact is created, it must be assigned one and only one Contact type.
Contact Type
Contact
1:1

The following standard Contact types are supported in Encompass. The Contact type determines which
attributes are relevant and required for a Contact of that type:

0. Anonymous: a limited number of attributes are required when creating this type. Its purpose is to
enable Contacts to be created with minimal touch, meaning no personally identifiable information
is required. This type is used when pre-loading Contacts into the system in batches for
streamlined order entry (e.g. simple prepaid activations) and is later changed to Named when an
actual person is onboarded by the CSP.
0. Named: this type is used when an actual person is created with personally identifiable
information. Rule 1 specifies the standard mandatory attributes however some jurisdictions
require additional attributes to be captured. For example, national identity number (e.g. driver’s
licence number, social security number, passport/visa number), capturing consent to satisfy GDPR
regulations, capturing email address for One Time Pin validations. Refer to Create Contact Use
Case (5.1.5) for a list of standard attributes.
0. Internal: this is a platform-specific Contact type used to manage unidentified payments and
roaming partner Customers.

RELATIONSHIPS
In Encompass, when a Contact is associated with a Customer, the relationship is either Primary or
Secondary.

Encompass Rules
# Rule Example
2 A Customer can only have one primary
Contact however it can have zero to
many secondary Contacts.
A Customer ‘XYZ Corp’ of type Business has a primary
Contact ‘Mary Black’ of type Named and two secondary
Contacts ‘John Smith’ (XYZ CFO) and ‘Janet Brown’ (XYZ
CIO) also of type Named.
3 A Contact who is associated with a
Customer in a primary relationship
assumes full authority over the
Customer’s information and accounts. A
Party Role (ref 4.2.1.4) is therefore not
required to be specified for primary
Contacts.
Mary Black is a primary Contact for Mary Black the
Customer. A party role is not required as the nature of
the relationship is clear.

Commented [CD4]: Pending Bug as at time of writing the
default value is Customer which is wrong as Contacts do
not have to be Customers.

4.1.4.3 PARTY ROLES (TMF669)
A Party Role is an attribute of a Contact->Customer association that describes the nature of the
relationship a secondary Contact has with a Customer. If a Contact will only ever be a primary Contact, a
party role is not required.
A Party Role type is a designated role that clarifies the capacity in which the secondary Contact is
operating. The following Party Role types are standard:
• Legal Entity Responsible Party: the Contact has full authority to interact with the CSP on behalf
of the Customer.
• Authorized Person: this Party Role assumes the Contact is authorized to inquire on a Customer’s
accounts.
• Service User: this Party Role assumes the Contact is limited to service-related inquires.
It is assumed that <client> uses an IAM (Identity Access Management) application to control a Contact’s
channel access level for the above Party Roles and any additional implementation-specific Party Roles.
A Contact can have zero to many party role types. A Contact can operate using different party role types
for different Customers. For example:

Contact Contact
Type
Associated
Customer
Customer
Type
Type of
Relationship
Contact->Customer
Association

John
Smith
Named XYZ Corp (John
is the CFO)
Business Secondary Legal Entity

(Janet is the
CIO)

Model Rules
# Rule Example
4 When a Contact is associated with a
Customer in a secondary relationship, the
party role type that explains the relationship
is mandatory.
Mary Black is the primary Contact for the business
Customer ‘XYZ Corp’. This implies she has full
authority hence she doesn’t need a party role for
the association.

Page 27 of 131

However, John Smith and Janet Brown are both
secondary Contacts to ‘XYZ Corp’. John has a ‘Legal
Entity Responsible Party’ party role association with
‘XYZ Corp’ meaning that he has joint responsibilities
with Mary and can act on her behalf when she is
unavailable. Janet can make inquiries as she is an
‘Authorized Person’ however she does not have full
authority over the XYZ Corp accounts like Mary and
John.
5 A secondary Contact can be associated with
a Customer using max 1 party role type. This
is enforced by the Encompass data model. It
is therefore advised to establish an
association with the party role that provides
the highest authority level if this is the
desired outcome.
Janet Brown cannot have a second party role for her
association with XYZ Corp. Only one party role can
be in effect at a point in time. In the above example
she is an Authorized Person and cannot act in any
other capacity.

 MODELING CUSTOMERS (TMF629)
A Customer is an entity that is used for billing and credit management purposes.
• A standalone Customer is one who is not in a financial/billing relationship with other Customers.
This definition applies to many residential consumers.
• A Customer hierarchy is a structure used to define a financial/billing relationship between two or
more Customers. Hierarchies are most used to model the billing relationship for business
Customers with multiple departments and payment/reporting structures. On occasion, they can
be used to model family billing relationships, however this is not recommended as it can overly
complicate the channel interactions.
4.1.5.0 CUSTOMER TYPES
The following standard Customer types are supported in Encompass. The Customer type determines
which attributes are relevant and required for a Customer of that type. The following are included:

0. Consumer: intended for residential consumers
0. Business: intended for business consumers
0. Unidentified Payments: an internal type used to store unidentified payments that cannot be
immediately guided to a Customer
0. Partner: an internal type used to model partners who may be in a revenue share arrangement
with the CSP

Some of the key information associated with a Customer is:
• The parent Customer (if this is a hierarchy)
• The primary Contact (TMF’s Customer’s Engaged Party)
• The Reporting Level (for standalone Customers this defaults to invoice however in hierarchies,
invoice, statement and ‘no reporting’ applies)
• Postal address for invoices/documents
• Bill cycle (when periodic billing occurs, e.g. 5
th
 of the month)
• Credit rating/score (e.g. low/medium/high risk)
• Credit Limit (this is a CSP-defined monetary figure typically mapped from the credit rating values)
• Payment details
Commented [CD5]: Cust types cannot be mixed in a
hierarchy, right?
Commented [CD6]: The current constraint (core or
MMS?) whereby a customer type and contact type must
match needs to be removed

• Company details (if Business Customer type)

The information mastered with an Encompass Customer relates to billing and credit management. It is not
intended to contain personal information that is unrelated to the billing function. The Contact entity may
be leveraged to store CRM-style information.

4.1.5.0 ACCOUNTS
A Customer has one or more accounts. The purpose of an account is to track all the charges, payments
and adjustments that the Customer is responsible for.
• An account can be an asset account or a liability account. Asset accounts are used to track money
owed to the CSP by a Customer or by a partner.
• A liability account is used to track money owed by the CSP to a Customer or a third party (e.g.
shares of revenue owed to partners, taxes levied on services that are owed to the revenue
commissioners, consumer deposits held).

4.1.5.0.0 ACCOUNT TYPES
The following standard account types are supported in Encompass:
0. (Mandatory Primary) Debtor: this is an asset account to track all monies owed to the CSP. Every
Encompass Customer, regardless of the types or postpaid/prepaid products purchased, has a
debtor account as its primary account.
0. Secondary Deposit: this is a liability account used to track money a CSP owes to a Customer.
When services are sold that require a deposit to be collected, the deposit is stored in this account.
Multiple deposit accounts can be created if the CSP has a need to separately manage individual
deposits.
0. Secondary Prepaid: this is a liability account used to track the money paid by a Customer to
which the CSP has a responsibility to provide service.

4.1.5.0 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ACCOUNT CUSTOMER
RELATIONSHIP
Every Encompass Customer, be they standalone or participating in a hierarchy, must have a primary
account.  Secondary accounts are optional.

 MODELLING CUSTOMER BILLING HIERARCHIES
A billing hierarchy is appropriate when:
• A single credit limit applies and must be enforced across a group of related Customers
• Roll up of charges is required from non-financially responsible Customers to a financially
responsible Customer
• A single payment is required to offset multiple Customer charges
Customers should be modelled individually when:
• They require different bill cycles, e.g. at the end of every month, middle of every month, quarterly
• Different account currencies are required for invoicing
• Different tax jurisdictions rules apply
• Separate invoices are required for different lines of business
• Legacy system pre migration validation requires Customer-specific reconciliation prior to a full
migration
Limitations:
• Billing hierarchy changes are supported, however changing a Customer type as part these
processes is not supported (e.g. a Business Customer leaving a hierarchy cannot become a root
Consumer Customer due to the extensive logic required to create and validate a new primary
Contact, reset credit limits, reevaluate offer eligibility, rederive type-specific attribute values and
moving bill cycles).
Commented [CD8]: Core enhancement is required to
turn this OFF by default and configurable if the CSP
requires specific accounts to be switched ON for
statements.
Commented [CD9]: CC seems to allow diff cust types
within a hierarchy. There needs to be a decision on
whether this should be allowed or not as the billing
behaviour is unclear. Surely mixing Consumer and
Business in a hierarchy will create a whole heap of
problems across the board.

The catalog also stores other specifications that drive a comprehensive set of capabilities within the Quote
to Cash business scenario. It influences the behavior of the Consumer Shopping Cart, Enterprise CPQ, and
Order Management capabilities of the proposed solution. This results in a catalog-driven Order Capture
and Order Management platform that can deliver consistent capabilities, regardless of the product or
service being ordered.
 PRODUCT OFFERS
The Product Catalog Design Tool within the CSG Solution provides a comprehensive solution for defining
and managing Customer offerings. At the core of this tool are Product Offers, which encapsulate the
essential product and service elements required for a product. These offers allow for the definition of
pricing, compatible additional elements, restrictions, bundling discounts, and selling rules. Product Offers
can be arranged into multi-level hierarchies and assigned to categories, facilitating easy modeling of
marketing offers within a central Product Catalog. This ensures that all product-related information is
correctly captured and distributed from order entry to provisioning, and that upselling opportunities are
always presented.
The Product Model in the CSG Solution serves as the master record holder for all product offering, billing,
and taxation information. Offers can be created from reusable components, enabling new offers to be
brought to market quickly. The product model provides the necessary components for <Client> to build
their Market Offers, ensuring that all components are listed for completeness.
4.2.1.1 CHARGING MODEL AND METHODS
Integral to the concept of a market offering is the Charging Model and Methods. The CSG Solution
supports a flexible and powerful structure for pricing and charging, with Price Books holding the pricing
and rate algorithms. Supported charging methods include usage charges, periodic recurring charges, nonrecurring charges, discounts, bonuses, and free units. These methods ensure that the charging and
pricing model can support current and future needs.
4.2.1.1 BUNDLING
Product Bundling allows <Client> to offer variable pricing or discounts based on the combination of
products purchased by the Customer. The CSG Solution supports bundling by allowing the definition of
price overrides to product components and applying bundling discounts to specific products or all services
on a Customer account.
4.2.1 PRODUCT CATALOG DESIGN TOOL
The Product Catalog Design Tool offers two unique capabilities tailored for different market segments:
Consumer and Enterprise. For Consumer, the tool provides a streamlined and user-friendly interface,
making it easy to clone, configure and manage products and services. This ensures accessibility and
efficiency for smaller businesses and individual consumers.
For Enterprise, the tool offers a broader design interface that supports CPQ led order capture and
negotiation, catering to the sophisticated needs of larger organizations. This includes advanced
configuration options, and integration capabilities with other enterprise systems.
For organizations that support a diverse consumer and enterprise Customer base, the CSG Solution is
uniquely positioned to support products designed for both simple and complex ordering experiences.
TMF-aligned Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is also embedded in the design tool to further enhance
<Client>’s catalog management and flexibility.

Ultimately, this unified tool supports a federated catalog with a single Enterprise Product Catalog (EPC) in
Encompass. This centralized, accessible approach ensures consistency and efficiency in product
management across different departments and business units, allowing the organization to quickly adapt
to market changes and Customer demands. Additionally, <Client> has the flexibility to tailor their SMB
market catalog to either a Consumer-type experience or an Enterprise-type experience, depending on
their specific needs.
The CSG Product Catalog Design tool within the browser-based user interface allows product managers to
rapidly assemble new products and offerings to take to market without the need to invoke new IT projects.
 UNIFIED PRODUCT CATALOG
The CSG solution is by design a convergent platform and has been proven to cater for any services and
products:
• Mobile & Wireless
• Fixed & Broadband
• Cloud Services (SAAS, hosted solutions...)
• Wholesale and Enterprise Solutions ( SAT, P2P,  PN, Connected Office, LAN/WAN...)
• 3rd Party Products ( AS, news, videos, music...)
• OTT products (Mobile T  Channels, Movie Studios...)
• Infrastructure and Contracts (Purchase Orders, Implementations, Feasibility, Instalments...)

4.2 CASE MANAGEMENT DATA MODEL

Encompass offers a comprehensive case management capability, allowing all aspects of Customer’s
interaction with <Client> to be captured. All case information is recorded against the relevant Customer
and can be accessed subsequently in the future. This data is captured via three main objects:
• Cases
• Issues

YYYY> CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 33 of 131

• Actions
An association of these objects is depicted in the figure below.

Figure 55: Cases, Issues and Actions Associations

A case is created when a Customer communicates with <Client> and represents a single interaction with
that Customer. A case records the details of the interaction, which may include several different requests
the Customer may make, including sales orders, payments, or enquiries raised. These requests are
referred to as issues and are specific to the type of request they handle. A case is not considered resolved
until all issues in the case are resolved.
Most of the time the User can resolve the Customer’s request immediately, but some requests may require
tasks to be completed by other parts of the organization. Encompass captures these tasks as actions,
which can be arranged into sequential or parallel flows. Actions are the individual steps in these flows and
Encompass allows the history of actions performed for a Customer to be captured.
Most actions are created automatically by the system in response to actions taken by the User, however in
some cases the User can manually request an action be queued.
Examples of manual actions are listed below:
• Follow Up Call – When a User wants to enter an action to call the Customer back in response to
some question that they may have asked.
• Follow Up Adjustment – When investigation is required to determine if adjustment credit should
be given to the Customer e.g. Customer complains about poor service quality and threatens to
cancel the service, as an incentive the User may offer credit adjustment but may want to look into
Customer’s credit history to decide.

• Discount Approval Request – Created manually for a back-office team to investigate if a discount
greater than the maximum threshold could be applied to the order.
• Treatment Manual Intervention – If a Customer was marked as for Manual Intervention, then
when their balance becomes overdue this action is automatically created by the Collection Process
for backend User to engage with the Customer.
Actions are automatically assigned to an individual or a work group and have a target duration which
determines the due date for completion. The target duration can consider a working day calendar e.g.
complete within five business days. A User can then take the next pending action off their own personal
action queue, or the queues for any work groups they are a member of, to progress the action to
completion.
Notification, via on screen alerts or emails, can be configured to remind Users to complete outstanding
actions or warn managers of potential due date breaches, and escalation paths can be configured to reassign actions when teams cannot service the action in time.

Figure 56: Encompass Case with Multiple Issues
User interaction statistics, specifically latency of discrete User interactions, is available in the Encompass
Customer Management health monitoring facility.
Collecting User interaction latency statistics enhances the regular snapshot of how Encompass Customer
Management is performing. This is used to measure Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and identify areas in
need of performance improvement.

Scope 21: Case Management

 CASE ISSUES
Encompass CRM will provide the ability to search for a Customer based on defined search criteria, once
the Customer is successfully returned then the CSR can log the interaction as an Issue when they trigger
one of the following operations:
• Manage Contact
• Manage Customer
• Sales Order
• Change Of Ownership
• Balance Enquiry
• New Payment
• Payment Enquiry
• Promise To Pay
• Account Adjustment
• Trouble Shooting
• Customer Service
• Compose Email
A case is always associated to a Customer account, a Customer account can have multiple open/closed
cases associated.

An attribute on the case will identify the source of the Case, this could be Call Centre, Store, iCare, system
generated via a Treatment etc.
The CSR will attempt to resolve the Customer enquiry immediately but if they cannot then they may have
to hand off the enquiry to another representative, this can be achieved by creating an Action.

Table 7: Action Types
 ACTION OVERRIDE
When creating the set of System Action Types, Encompass will initially supply default action type attributes
values, (e.g., Action Duration, Work Group etc.) but over time the CSP may wish to override these values
following its own internal team reorganizations or output of action reporting. Therefore, Encompass will
provide the CSP with client-maintained reference data tables to support the overriding of the default
action attributes per action type. Upon action instance creation, Encompass will look up this table and
utilize the override values if defined.

5. USER JOURNEYS & USE CASES
This section outlines the core business processes provided and supported by the CSG solution for <Client>.
The User Journeys and Use Cases are organized around a standardized framework. The following journeys
are applicable:
1. Explore
A Prospect becomes aware of the products and services offered by <Client>. They evaluate the
offerings, potentially register their interest, and request follow-up communication to learn more.
2. Join / Buy
A Prospect decides to proceed with a purchase, transitioning into a Customer. During this process,
they are onboarded, and the selected product(s) are purchased and activated.
3. Use
A Customer updates their personal information or modifies their portfolio of previously purchased
services.
4. Change
A Customer makes changes to their personal data or to the set of services that they have previously
purchased.
5. Get Help
A Customer engages with <Client> to report an issue and track its resolution. The resolution process
may include adjustments to the Customer’s financial balance.
6. Pay
The Customer fulfills payment obligations for outstanding amounts. Payments can be initiated by the
Customer or processed automatically by the system.
7. Do Not Pay
If a Customer fails to make payments within the agreed timeframe, their account becomes delinquent,
and overdue debts are pursued through collection activities.
8. Leave
A Customer terminates their commercial relationship with <Client>, or <Client> initiates termination of
the relationship.
9. Get & Stay Ready
This journey encompasses one-time or recurring activities performed by <Client> to prepare products
for market launch, manage updates to the product catalog, and support day-to-day business
operations.
Each User Journey is detailed through a set of Use Cases that define specific steps within broader business
processes. In some instances, these Use Cases also address key variations in end-to-end process flows.
Use Case Actors
For clarity and consistency, the term "User" is employed to represent the actor within this context. Actors
may include CSR Agents, Supervisors, or Managers engaging with the Call Center channel. Given that
many Use Cases support multiple digital channels, the term "User" may also refer to Contacts or
Customers interacting with CSP self-care web or mobile applications, as well as third-party sales or CRM
systems. These digital channels interface with the Encompass Platform APIs, enabling the "User" to
encompass a diverse range of individuals across various roles and interaction points.
Commented [CD10]: Add optional Ucs that can be part of
numerous Ucs such as OTP, AOC, Service availability, CC
Token I’f as we need an estimate in the SET for them

Use Case Steps, Video Demo & Supporting APIs
Click on the ‘Link to Use Case Flows, Videos and APIs’ in each  se Case to navigate to a detailed
description. The Customer Connect Call Centre is used as the sample channel for many Use Case videos to
demonstrate a CSG pre-designed flow. As Encompass APIs support multiple digital channels, the swagger
files for the supporting APIs are included with each Use Case to guide channel integrations. Certain
channels may wish to combine and/or slightly alter the flow by rearranging the API call sequence. CSG can
advise on impacts of channel-specific deviations on Use Case behavior.
Data Models Underpinning Use Cases
Please refer to the following Encompass Data Models for context prior to reviewing the Use Cases:
• Contact & Customer Model <insert microsite link>
• Product Model <insert microsite link>
• Case Model <insert microsite link>
Sample Catalog Offers to showcase Use Cases
To facilitate the demonstration of Use Cases, a predefined set of sample offers has been populated within
the Encompass catalog and included as part of <Client>’s solution. Detailed specifics of these offers can be
found in Chapter 1.1.1. If you wish to create offers with similar characteristics, cloning and localizing these
pre-existing offers provides an efficient approach to accelerate time-to-market.
Use Case Numbering
The User Journeys and Use Cases follow a standardized numbering scheme. Please note, gaps in the Use
Case numbering below implies that that certain Use Cases supported by other CSG modules are not in the
scope of the agreed contract.

This Use Case describes how a User can create a new Contact. To prevent duplicate records, channels may
initiate a Search Contact (HLP-01) prior to creation. The level of Contact information collected, validated, and

required (CHG-01) for specific interactions. Within the Call Centre channel, this Use Case may optionally
transition to Create Customer (EXP-15) if the new Contact is ready to place an immediate order

Commented [CD13]: Q&O Use Case
Commented [RA14]: Needs clarification that there are
other ways to create  contacts (CHG-04). So perhaps say
“This use case describes how a user creates a
new Contact, representing an individual or an
organization. The Contact stores personal details such as
name, address, and email. A Contact serves as a
foundational element that can be used to:
•Initiate a Product Enquiry (EXP-09)
•Create a Customer record linked to the Contact (EXP15)
Additionally, in a separate use case CHG-04, users may
create a Secondary Contact and associate it with an
existing Customer.
To minimize duplication, channels may first perform
a Search Contact (HLP-01) before initiating creation.
The scope and depth of information collected, validated,
or derived during Contact creation depends on the
intended use of the Contact. Optional data enrichment
may be applied using CHG-01 for specific interaction
needs.
Commented [RA15]: Perhaps distinguish between
‘personal identification’ and ‘business contact’ , as different
ids needed (e.g. company reg papers v. national id card).
...
Commented [RA16]: General comment - the related
business logic should be grouped together. E,g,

This Use Case describes how a User can submit a product enquiry for a Prospect. The Prospect details are
retrieved (5.8.2) or created (0) prior to the enquiry. The rules regarding eligibility of a product reside with the
catalog definition along with the associated order entry flow. For example, a ‘Service Availability Check’ may
be required for some fixed products whilst a ‘Port In MSISDN’ option may be part of some mobile products.
Consult the Sales Order Use Cases (5.3) for order capture examples used within a Product Enquiry.
Product Enquiry information is a useful indicator of product interest and could be used to inform sales
campaigns. Product Enquiries can be easily converted into sales orders (5.3.1) as much of the information has
been captured to support a sale.
The Use Case is complete when a non-binding, indicative price is provided and saved based on the
information supplied in the enquiry and the current pricing details. If the offer has tax inclusive prices the full
amount will be displayed broken out by type of charge. The indicative price excludes ‘end of bill period’specific charges or discounts related to consumption or timeliness of payment. Advanced estimation of such
amounts is invalid.

• If a catalog offer has a maximum cardinality of one, the Customer will be restricted from purchasing an
additional offer of the same type.
• Customers with outstanding debt or those currently undergoing treatment processes may be
temporarily disqualified from purchasing further postpaid offers.
Additionally, the Customer’s existing active products may render them eligible for multi-product discounts or
preferential pricing on new offers.
Upon submission, a PDF document containing the enquiry details is generated and linked to the product
enquiry for future reference. Should the Customer decide to proceed with a purchase later, the product
enquiry can be seamlessly converted into a sales order, as described in section (5.3.1).

This Use Case describes how a User can submit a quote request as part of the CPQ process. Due to the
sophisticated nature of CPQ ordering, the Prospect must be onboarded as a Customer prior to the quote
commencing. The combination of product and Customer information influences the quoted amount.
For fixed products, the CPQ (Configure Price Quote) process is initiated, beginning with service address
validation and site qualification to confirm the serviceability of the requested locations. A plan and relevant
products are offered based on a standard rate card that utilizes a conventional pricing model. Additional
specific rate cards featuring discounted rates may be included based on market segments or Customer
needs. As part of the CPQ process, further offers may be presented based on various criteria, which may
trigger a <Client>-specific designated approval process. Any additional sales order information is collected as
needed, and subsequently, a quote detailing the services to be delivered is generated and sent to the
Customer representative via their preferred Contact method. This quote includes a comprehensive list of
quoted line items with pricing details, including gross selling price, discounts applied, and net selling price.
The Use Case is complete when a quote document is generated, saved, and communicated to the Customer.

This Use Case describes how a User can create a new Customer for an existing Contact. When a Contact is
initially created (0) or retrieved (5.8.2) the User can opt to create a new Customer to associate with the
existing Contact. The platform supports predefined Customer types (4.2.2.1), which specify the information
that must be provided by the User, set by default by the system, obtained from third-party sources, or
derived from other attribute values, as well as the permissible value ranges. User-provided data may
include billing preferences such as preferred payment methods, autopay or direct debit details, billing
address, preferred invoice delivery method, and tax status. Information sourced externally from third parties
may include attributes such as credit score. System-defaulted values may encompass billing and creditrelated details such as bill cycle, invoice format, credit class, monetary credit limit, and tax type, which can be
derived from a combination of User-supplied information, the Customer’s segment type and the onboarding
date.
A Customer can be either a person or a business that buys products or services. Customers are grouped into
segments/types such as 'Consumer' or 'Business' and they are linked to one or more Contacts who represent
them.

This Use Case describes how a User can create and maintain a billing hierarchy. A billing hierarchy is a treestructured arrangement of customers, enabling one customer (the parent) to oversee and manage multiple
related customers (the children). Such hierarchies facilitate consolidated billing and reporting, allowing
charges from child customers to be aggregated and billed to the parent customer, unless otherwise
specified. The customer at the top of the hierarchy is referred to as the root customer. A customer with
subordinate customers is termed a parent customer, while a customer with a superior is referred to as a child
customer. In multi-level hierarchies, a customer may simultaneously act as both a parent and a child.
Key actions involved in creating and maintaining a billing hierarchy include:
• Creating a child customer under a selected parent customer, with either both entities sharing the same
primary contact or a new contact is added for the new customer.
• Converting a child customer into a standalone root customer, retaining the existing primary contact.
• Re-parenting a child customer by assigning it to a different parent within the hierarchy.

Customers within a hierarchy share the same bill cycle and are processed by the same billing resources for
efficiency. By default, child Customers are financially responsible for the charges their offers generate, and
they will receive an invoice. However their responsibilities can be modified such that their charges roll up to
their parent to pay and they receive a statement of account activity, or they have online access only to view
their charges.
This Use Case is considered complete when a parent-child billing relationship is established or when an

This Use Case describes how a User can convert a Product Enquiry to a Sales Order for either a Prospect or an
existing Customer. The Product Enquiry is first retrieved (5.8.6), after which the User may modify the enquiry
as needed, such as by adding or removing optional items.
For Prospects, a Customer record must be created prior to conversion (5.1.13). If the products involved
require a serviceability check (5.1.15), it is assumed that this step was completed during the initial Product
Enquiry and does not need to be repeated. Where applicable, the Use Case also encompasses the booking of
appointments for device installation, FTTX connection, site checks, or other necessary services. For products
requiring inventory selection at the point of order capture, the relevant inventory is retrieved and allocated to
the order.
For detailed examples of order capture by offer type within this conversion process, please refer to the Sales
Order Use Cases. Note that certain offers may necessitate an upfront payment prior to order submission.

This Use Case describes how a User can submit a sales order for a mobile product and services. Product
Catalog maintenance is fully within <Client>’s control however CSG supplies a suite of predefined working
offers designed to be cloned and tailored to accelerate time to market (see 1.1.1).
The product definitions in the catalog drive the order capture process. Some mobile offers include handsets
charged through recurring instalments whilst others are SIM only consumption plans.
• Individual mobile service orders can take many forms. For example:
- MSISDNs can be pre-paired with SIM Cards and activated in a pending state on the network ahead of
time. In this instance the sales order is a simple selection from a list of pending services and fulfillment
comprises of a network activation request.
- Other offer definitions require the selection of a standard/vanity MSISDN from available inventory
during the order capture process and fulfillment handles the pairing with a physical SIM Card from stock
and the subsequent network activation.
- Offers available for sale through retail outlets may involve a sales rep selecting a SIM from in-store

stock, entering the SIM’s ICCID whilst fulfillment handles the number pairing and order update with the
active IMSI and MSISDN.
• Bulk mobile service orders can take many forms. For example:
- a service quantity and potentially the desired number range for the group of MSISDNs is supplied.
Fulfillment manages the inventory selections, pairing and individual service network activations.
- a CSV file is supplied with the paired MSISDNs and SIMs. Individual orders are created for the entries in
the CSV file.
Should <Client> wish to provide an advice of charge for the new offer selections, this is supported through
extensions. Certain offers and products may be configured to bill in arrears or in advance, and in some cases
an upfront payment is required prior to order submission. Except for Autopay/Direct Debit, the Customer’s
preferred payment method is used for upfront payments however this can be changed at order capture time
should the Customer wish to use alternate payment instruments. Successful authorization of payment
produces a receipt and enables the order to proceed.
Back dating and future dating of orders is supported for various business scenarios; however, network
activations honour the provisioning date/time for consumption.
The Use Case is complete when a sales order is successfully submitted for fulfillment. For simple orders, this
marks the point of no return as fulfillment can be very quick. Complex orders with prolonged fulfillment
timeframes support in-flight order fulfilment changes.

This Use Case describes how a User can submit a mobile sales order that includes a service number
belonging to another carrier. The order capture process is similar to Create Mobile Sales Order (5.3.2)
however when the desired MSISDN selection occurs, the Customer opts to supply a number that is currently
active on another carrier’s network. A MNP Port In issue is automatically created and a MNP Port In request is
triggered to the donor carrier upon order submission. When the Port In Request is successful, the supplied
number is stored in inventory with details of the donor carrier and the ported number is used to provision the
service on the CSP’s network.
The Use Case is complete when a sales order is successfully submitted for fulfillment that includes a MNP
Port In request to the donor carrier.

This Use Case describes how a User can capture an order that includes either a negotiated discount or a price
override. The catalog definition dictates which offers/charges are eligible for negotiation and these are
identifiable by the channels. Negotiated discounts and price overrides may apply to recurring, one-off
charges and deposits. Realtime charges cannot be negotiated. The following terms distinguish the prices and
charges involved in a negotiation:
• The list price is the original price assigned to a charge in the catalog and it has its own GL Code.
• A price override alters the list price with an alternative price. The catalog supports configurable min
and max override prices to prevent against fraud. An override price is not time limited. The override
price appears as a single line item on the invoice and its GL is the same as the list price.
• The catalog also supports time-limited introductory prices which temporarily alter the list price for a
configured duration (e.g. 6 bill cycles). Introductory prices are a form of price override that revert to
the list price when the introductory period has elapsed. The GL Code used for this charge is the same
as the list price.

• A negotiated discount can be either a fixed amount or a percentage off the list, or introductory, price
(whichever applies at time of sale). Basic validation is provided to prevent amounts that exceed the
list/introductory price. When a percentage is specified and an introductory price is in effect, the
discount will automatically adjust when the introductory period elapses. The User managing the
negotiation can also specify a discount end date for recurring charges only, after which the discount
no longer applies. The discount appears as a separate line item on the invoice along side the list
price and has its own GL code.
For prices that are configured as taxable (either tax exclusive on inclusive), the tax amounts that will apply to
the charges are calculated and displayed. When the negotiation is complete, the User confirms the
agreement (Price Breakup). When viewing a negotiated order prior to submission, the User can see the Price
Breakup showing the list price, the introductory price (if applicable) and duration, the override price or the
negotiated discount amount and the discount end date.

entitlement bucket(s), postpaid remaining available credit, prepaid balance) is sufficient.
Prior to authorization, the system attempts to reserve a quota based on the type of the
event (e.g. 30secs for a national voice call, 1Mbs for a data event). The cost of the quota
is rated. If there are no balances that can fund the event quota, the event will not be

If the quota is available in an event-specific entitlement bucket (e.g. national voice mins),
the event will be authorized. Other balances may also be eligible to fund the event (e.g. a
monetary entitlement, a prepaid balance, a postpaid remaining available credit). A single

 This Use Case describes how Customers with usage-based services draw down on the
entitlement buckets that are specific to them or their eligible services. For example, a
mobile subscription service includes a default monthly allocation of X national voice
minutes, Y GBs data and Z text Msgs.
If a product definition permits, Customers with multiple usage-based services can share
the entitlement allocations across eligible services, e.g. a parent Customer purchases 3
mobile services for family members with a pool of data that can be consumed by all
service users. Upon event completion, a CDR is generated and stored in the system for a
predefined retention period. Individual events that have consumed from entitlements
are not processed by billing, however the total consumption amounts for a bill period
are available on the xml invoice. The realtime entitlement balances are available through
APIs to all supported channels at any point in time. The CDRs are also available for
inspection through APIs should a Customer wish to inquire on their individual
entitlement event usage.
The Use Case is complete when a rated event is successfully authorized against, and
consumes from, a service or Customer-specific eligible entitlement bucket, a CDR is

This Use Case describes how Customers with usage-based services draw down on the
entitlement buckets that are shared with other Customers within or outside of a
hierarchy.
If a product definition permits, Customers can share their entitlements with others
within their hierarchy (if applicable) or non-related Customers. A specific service owns
the entitlement however it can be shared with other services through a hiararchial
relationship or an explicit association. The proportions of consumption by associated,
eligible services is not regulated. The precedence rules typically dictate that Customerspecific entitlements are consumed first followed by shared entitlement consumption.

Use Case API(s) supporting channels:  X

This Use Case describes how Customers with usage-based services draw down on their
remaining available credit.
Overage events do not consume from entitlements. They are rated using plan-specific or
default rates and they are authorized against the remaining available credit balance. If
there is insufficient credit, an overage event is not authorized. When an overage event is
initiated, the available credit balance is dynamically updated. When the credit is
exhausted, events are no longer authorized. The available credit can be increased by
making a payment.
When an event completes, a CDR is generated. By default, all overage CDRs, with the
exception of data, are sent to billing and will appear on a detailed invoice. CDR
aggregation is automatically enabled for data usage as it does not benefit from
individual invoice representation. The items that comprise the aggregate are available
for inspection during the online retention period.
The Use Case is complete when a rated event is successfully authorized against, and
consumes from, a postpaid available credit, an overage CDR is generated and the
remaining credit balance is adjusted accordingly.

Low balance thresholds are configured to notify Customers when they are at risk of
service interruption due to insufficient balance. The thresholds can be set on
entitlements, account balances and available credit.
As the balance reaches the threshold, a warning is generated to ensure the Customer
has an opportunity to increase the balance by making a payment, topping up a prepaid
account, purchasing an entitlement add-on or transferring balance from elsewhere.
Several threshold notifications are possible prior to service interruption.

Invoice
Use Case API(s) supporting channels:

This Use Case describes how an invoice is generated at billing time for a postpaid
Customer. When a Customer is acquired, a bill cycle is assigned based on rules such as
Customer type, date of acquisition, size of billing hierarchy, and so on. The rules ensure
the Customer is on the most appropriate bill cycle to facilitate timely billing and lower
the CSP’s exposure to bad debt. Bill cycles are also designed to ensure the platform
processing is optimized and billing windows are minimised. A bill format is also assigned
based on the Customer type as the invoice information typically differs across consumer
and enterprise segments.
At billing, the following items are included on the Customer’s invoice as well as charges
related to any child Customers that do not have financial liability:
• recurring charges, arrears and/or in advance, pro-rata adjusted if applicable
• one-time charges, activation/cancellation/early termination fees, one-time
purchases and penalties
• overage usage charges, including late-landing charges from a previous period

Commented [JW93]: EI 240318 - Proforma Invoice

Commented [JW94]: Feedback from Johan:
•It is a common requirement to add additional
information to any of the areas on the invoice, it could
be the customer info, service info, charges, events,
subtotals, etc.
•There is a common requirement to only generate
itemised billing (individual usage event level) for
customers which have opted for it.
•When itemised billing is generated, it is common to
want data events to be aggregated (via CSP specified
criteria), while other events are not aggregated at all,
since voice and SMS events are individually meaningful
with A party B part, date/time of the event, etc. while
data events are largely meaningless to the customer
being billed.

This Use Case describes how a user can update contact
details, regardless of how the contact was originally
onboarded. It supports both:
•Contacts initially created with minimal information
(e.g., to enable catalog browsing), who later provide
full personal details (e.g., prior to first purchase), and
•Contacts onboarded with complete information from
the outset, whose details may change over time.

These updates can be made either individually or using
the Global Edit function for multiple fields.

Once submitted, the new values are validated, saved, and
are immediately available for use. A full audit trail is
maintained, preserving historical values with date ranges
for traceability.

The Use Case is complete when the updated details are

This Use Case describes how a User can update modifiable Customer details. Examples of such updates
include changes to billing address, preferred and default payment methods, direct debit or autopay
information, and the level of invoice detail. In addition, <Client> may update sensitive customer informationCommented [RA98]: I don’t think localization are the
same as 5.1.5...e.g. this one (from create contact) seems
invalid ”X forms of personal identification for validation
check” because  the update use case says it’s a
precondition of the use case.

So - recommend list them explicitly.
Commented [RA99]: Customer’s always expect the ability
to 1) allow only certain users to update certain attributes
(e.g. not everyone can update the credit class in the
customer), and 2) have some workflow to get approval for
the change...Its probably covered in a security UC, but I
think it needs to be added to the Localisation (or business
logic, if that is  right place)

This could be a common requirement across many screens
- so perhaps it needs to be called out in the security UC
(but I could not see one in this doc)?
Commented [RA100]: General comment (applicable to
localisation and extension sections): Recommend always
use section name as well – means the reader wont bother
having to look, as they will understand the rationale for
the xref
Commented [CD101]: This is subject to an EI in 25.3 need to understand what is planned for this.
Commented [RA102]: Suggest remove ‘Additional
Comms’ , and update wording from  “Trigger email to
Contact describing updates to circumvent fraudulent
activity.“ to Trigger notification  to Contact describing
updates to circumvent fraudulent activity.’ and cross ref to
some Notification UC which then handle all the various
channels supported (email, SMS, push notifications etc).
Commented [RA103]: Best to include all the relevant
business logic from create contact (e,g validate address,
validate email etc.). Note that you cant just as ‘as for
section 5.1.5’ as not all are applicable for update
Commented [RA104]: I don’t think all the ones 5.1.5 are
applicable., I.e. Outbound identity validation, integration
with an external national id database to validate and
populate some Contact detail
The use case says it’s a precondition of use case i.e. done

such as credit details-through back-office collections processes. This Use case may also cover swapping out a
Customer’s primary contact with a secondary contact.
Certain modifications may prompt the rederivation of associated read-only attribute values prior to saving,
for example a change of credit class/rating may automatically change the associated credit limit. Once the

This Use Case describes how a User can associate an additional Contact with a Customer. The Customer is
retrieved (5.8.4) and the User selects one of the following options:
• Associate an existing Contact with the Customer. The User searches for the Contact (5.8.1) and
retrieves its details (5.8.2).
• Create a new Contact to associate with the Customer. The Contact details are captured and validated
(as per 0).
The Contact association is secondary as there is already a primary Contact assigned to the Customer.
The Contact’s Party Role Type is preconfigured to define the relationship between the newly associated
Contact and the Customer, governing the Contact’s access permissions to Customer-related data. This default
setting can be modified to any value specified in section 1.1.1.1.
The Use Case is complete when the Contact is successfully associated with the Customer in a secondary
relationship and a Party Role has been assigned to explain the Contact’s access level to Customer
information.

This Use Case describes how a User can change an offer’s current pricing plan to another supported pricing
plan option. The typical trigger for a pricing plan change is increased/decreased consumption that prompts
the Customer to review, or the CSP to recommend, other optional plans available within the offer with more
suitable rates and/or larger/smaller entitlement allocations. The pricing plan change may result in
higher/lower recurring charges and trigger fulfillment workflow that includes provisioning actions.

This Use Case describes how a User can order an optional add-on to supplement an existing active offer.
When configuring catalog offers, standard practice is to include certain mandatory items, while also providing
a selection of optional items (add-ons) that can be purchased at the customer’s discretion. To facilitate
organization and navigation, items within the catalog may be grouped into categories such as:
• Add-ons (e.g., entitlement packs)
• Value Added Services (e.g., paper invoice options, device insurance plans, Over-The-Top content
purchases)
• Devices (e.g., handsets, watches, wearables, accessories, set-top boxes)
• Financials (e.g., deposits, top-ups)
Prior to purchase, users can view the charges associated with each add-on through the catalog browsing
functionality (5.1.3). Add-ons are governed by cardinality rules, which specify the maximum number of
identical add-ons a customer may have active concurrently. The system supports the purchase of multiple
instances of the same add-on type (e.g., two 1GB data packs), up to the defined limit. Additionally, customers
may purchase multiple different types of add-ons simultaneously (e.g., two 1GB data packs and one paper
invoice option).
Eligibility for add-ons is determined by catalog-defined rules, which are evaluated at the point of sale to
ensure the customer qualifies for the selected add-on. Add-ons may be either recurring or time-limited (e.g.,
a seven-day roaming pack), and certain add-ons may initiate a provisioning request to the network upon
purchase.

By default, the system assigns a reason for each add-on purchase based on its category (e.g., upgrade);

This Use Case describes how a User can change the current active offer to another compatible catalog offer.
The change may be scheduled immediately, at a future date, or at the next renewal cycle. The catalog offer
definition determines the type of offer changes (upgrades/downgrades) that are permitted, which features
differ between the offers, and the price impacts of changing from one offer to the other. Incompatible offers
are not available for selection.
The changes incurred from moving from the current offer to the new offer (e.g. items added/removed) are
highlighted, including the non-prorated list price of the new offer and inclusions. The new price can be
negotiated if the catalog definition allows for it and optional items in the new offer, over and above the likefor-like items in the old offer, can be added.
Like a sales order, an upfront fee may be required prior to order submission using the stored payment
instrument or alternate instrument(s). The change of offer may trigger fulfillment workflow that includes a
provisioning update on the network.
The Use Case is complete when the new offer is active, and the old offer is inactive.

date/time of transfer along with any outstanding money owed from that period. The new owner can use the
product/service from the date/time of transfer and is eligible for all charges from that date onwards. All new
service activity is recorded against the new owner. Pro rata adjustments may apply to charge durations less
than a full bill period for both the previous owner and the new owner.

Commented [JW146]: Feedback from Johan:
 - Handling of SLAs
JW - for residential and immediate closure, this is not so
significant, but it is something to be considered for HLP-25
- I guess we can cover that in definition of CSP specific
actions for HLP-25
 - How does the CSR know if it is a network problem - I
think some reference to interaction with the Incidents
information is needed in here to support the
conversation..... Caller - "I am in Guildford, and my phone
is not working", CSR - "OK, we have a major incident in
Guildford, engineers are aware and the estimated
restoration time is 6 hours, please call back in 6 hours if
your fault persists". The CSR needs to be aware that
Guildford has a problem - they have the banner and they
have the Incidents listing

This Use Case describes how a User can create an account adjustment. An adjustment can be the result of a
Customer dispute (5.8.30), a charging/billing error, or an automated internal process such as treatment.
For CSR-initiated adjustments, the monetary amount is limited to ensure against fraud. An adjustment type and reason
must be captured to classify the type of adjustment, and a note is required to explain why the adjustment was applied.
When the allowable limit is exceeded, an escalation action is triggered to a superior for approval with some explanatory
notes. The adjustment is not applied to the Customer’s account until the supervisor has reviewed the action and approves
it.
The Use Case is complete when an adjustment, within the allowable limit, is applied against the Customer’s account, or an

We should have a Create Incident UC in which the CSR

authorised CSRs - section 28.2 from the user-guide
describes this

I have created a UC holder for this in Confluence

Commented [JW163]: Feedback from Johan. I think this
is a list of product extensions, though they may be items
of business logic well - I find it rather hard to judge which
to be honest:
•The ability to automatically adjust the tax related to a
taxable charge when the taxable charge is adjusted
•The ability to automatically adjust administrative
charges which relate to an adjusted charge when the
charge on which the administrative charge was applied
is adjusted
•Ability to adjust a tax charge
•Ability to adjust a discount
•Ability to correctly account (typically using linear
revenue recognition, but this should be configurable)
for the revenue recognition for adjusted recurring
charges
•Capture of external adjustment id
•Ability to search using external adjustment id
•Adjustment limits which are different for different
types of adjustment transactions, per
tenant/geography serviced when the solution spans
multiple tenants/geographies
•Improved support for bulk adjustments

This Use Case describes how a User can create a dispute when a Customer challenges charged amounts, either
billed or unbilled. The challenge may relate to; a current balance (e.g. a Customer claims that an account or entitlement
balance is inaccurate), an invoice total, or a specific charge.
• To create an invoice dispute, recent invoices are retrieved (5.8.20) and the challenged invoice is selected for
dispute. The amount under dispute is entered. Validation prevents amounts more than the invoiced amount to be
disputed.  The Reason for the Dispute is selected from a list of common complaints and notes are required to
describe the dispute. Optionally, documentation can be added in support of the dispute. The dispute is saved, the
invoice is marked as disputed, and an action is created for a workgroup to investigate which leads to either a
dispute approval or rejection (5.8.31).
• For individual unbilled charge disputes, the User searches for account transactions (5.8.22) and selects the
desired charge to dispute (5.8.23). The User opts to dispute the charge, enters the dispute amount, the dispute
reason and comments. Charges under dispute are visible to the channels.
• For disputes at the account level, the User does not need to select a charge or invoice. Similar details are
collected, and the account itself is flagged as under dispute.
The dispute remains open until resolved. A dispute may result in an adjustment (5.8.26) if the Customer’s complaint is
deemed valid.
The Use Case is complete when a dispute issue is saved with a follow up action.

This Use Case describes how a User can approve or reject a dispute. When a dispute is raised, the User who
initiated the dispute may also have the authority to resolve it. In some organizations, however, the
management of open disputes is handled by centralized teams. Users within these teams are assigned to
specific workgroups, and dispute actions are routed to the appropriate workgroup for follow-up.
Accordingly, there are two primary entry points to this use case:
1. Originating User: The User who created the dispute retrieves the relevant customer details (5.8.4)
and searches for the customer’s disputes (5.8.33).
2. Dispute Resolution Workgroup: A member of a designated dispute resolution workgroup selects
the dispute action from a work queue for further processing.
This structure ensures that disputes can be managed efficiently, either directly by the originating user or
through specialized resolution teams.
Approval may involve the User creating an adjustment for the amount under dispute (5.8.26) providing it falls
within the  ser’s permissible limit and updating the dispute status to ‘Accepted’. If the disputed amount
exceeds the limit, the User can escalate the case by creating an action for another workgroup (e.g.
Adjustment Approval) to follow up. The user has the option to issue either a full or partial credit and must
specify the type of adjustment to be applied, such as a credit note or an account adjustment. Once processed,
adjustments are immediately reflected in the current account balances.
If the dispute is rejected, the user updates the status to ‘Rejected’. In both acceptance and rejection scenarios,
the user is required to add comments providing context for the decision.
The Use Case is complete when the dispute update is submitted.

This Use Case describes how a User can resolve an issue that contains a follow up action. This is a generic Use
Case for issues that have generated follow-up actions that require resolution before the parent issue can be
closed.
For troubleshooting issues where a third-party incident management/ticketing system is integrated (5.8.24), a
close action request may automatically trigger closure of the action and parent issue.
For manual closures, the User examines the information in the action and decides on an appropriate
resolution outcome. The User adds comments as context for the resolution.
The Use Case is complete when the follow-up action associated with an issue is closed and that closure
triggers the closure of the parent issue.

Encompass employs a 'Balance Forward' accounting method by default, where unpaid balances from prior
invoices are carried forward to the current invoice, with the aged debt period calculated from the initial date
an amount became overdue.
To minimize a customer's aged debt exposure, Encompass automatically prioritizes payment allocation to the
oldest outstanding amounts. If multiple invoices are overdue, payments are applied chronologically reducing
the risk of delinquency treatment when configured thresholds (e.g., days overdue) are triggered. This
approach optimizes cash flow while maintaining compliance with aging policies.
When a customer’s invoice is successfully located, the payment is promptly allocated to the corresponding
debtor account associated with the invoice. The customer’s available credit balance is adjusted positively by
the payment amount. If the payment exceeds the outstanding balance on the account, the account
transitions into a credit position.
In cases where the invoice identifier cannot be found, the payment is redirected to an internal account for
follow-up and resolution. A payment receipt is automatically generated as a formal record of the transaction.
It is important to note that for payments processed via the Call Centre channel, a specific invoice must be
selected (5.8.21) before the payment can be applied. As a result, unallocated payments are not applicable
within this channel.
The Use Case is complete when the account associated with the invoice is credited by the amount of the
payment and the remaining available credit is adjusted.

This Use Case describes how a User can transfer balance from an account to another account. The following
are examples of types of transfers:
• a parent Customer transfers credit from a postpaid debtor account to a child Customer’s prepaid
liability account to ensure continued service (recurring transfers can be done on postpaid)
• a  ser transfers an amount from a deposit account to a Customer’s debtor account (these transfers
can also be implemented automatically as part of a treatment workflow to offset amounts owing)
• a Customer transfers funds from a prepaid account to another Customer’s prepaid account that is
running short.
Transfers of funds are only possible if the donating Customer’s offer supports this capability. There may also
be a fee associated with a transfer. To receive a transfer into an account, the beneficiary must satisfy
<client’s> eligibility rules. There are limits on the maximum transfer amounts within certain timeframes.
Validation is performed to ensure the donor account has sufficient available credit/funds to cover the transfer
amount and the transfer amount does not breach any configured minimums or maximums. Validation is also
performed on the receiving account to ensure the amount to be received does not exceed a configured
periodic maximum (24hrs, 30 days).
The Use Case is complete when the donating account is debited by the transferred amount and the receiving
account is credited by the same amount.

This Use Case describes how a User can search for a reported missing payment. Payments imported into the
system via files (5.9.6) are stored in an internal suspense account if the originating customer cannot be
identified-often because of an incorrect invoice or account number provided at the time of payment. When a
Customer discovers that their payment has not been credited to their account, they typically contact the CSP
to initiate an enquiry.
The User typically begins by searching for the Customer’s payments (5.8.15) to confirm that the payment has
not been applied since the Customer last checked. If the payment remains unaccounted for, the User selects
the “Search  nidentified Payments” option, which displays all payments currently held in the suspense
account. To refine the search, the User can apply filters based on the information provided by the Customer,
such as payment date, location, amount, or payment type (e.g., credit card, cash). If the Customer can supply
a unique payment reference or receipt number, this should facilitate a direct match.
Full payment details are made available for review, enabling the User to verify whether any of the
unidentified payments correspond to the information provided by the Customer.
The Use Case is complete when any unidentified payments matching the search criteria are returned with
comprehensive details.

This Use Case describes how a  ser can cancel a payment that has been rejected by the Customer’s financial
institution. Encompass assumes that all autopay/direct-debit payment requests have been successful if no
reject files are received before the invoice due date.  All payments are posted to the customer accounts on
the due date, hence any reject files received by Encompass after this date must be processed to reject the
original Encompass payments and reverse the effect on the account balances.
Typically, this is implemented using an automated process (5.9.11) when the volume of payment rejections is
high. However, the facility is available to individually cancel payments when the number of rejections is very
low. The User locates the payment (5.8.16) and cancels it. The original payment and rejected payment cancel
each other out and the account balance is adjusted immediately. This may have the unfortunate consequence
of placing the Customer in treatment.
The Use Case is complete when the payment is cancelled, and the account balance is adjusted.

This Use Case describes how a User cancels an active market offer. A Customer may have either a single
active offer or multiple concurrent offers. If the offer is associated with an arrears-based subscription and
pro-rata billing is enabled, the final subscription charge will be adjusted to reflect only the period during
which the service was active. For offers paid in advance, a retrospective credit adjustment may be applied for
the unused portion of the subscription period.
Offer cancellation may also trigger early termination fees if a contract or minimum spend agreement is in
place, with the fee amount typically calculated based on the remaining commitment duration. An advice of
charge will notify the User of any fees incurred due to cancellation.
As part of a potential retention strategy, the User may be prompted to present the Customer with a more
attractive alternative (5.6.13).
Following cancellation, the Customer and their associated Contact(s) remain in the system, even in the
absence of active offers. This approach facilitates future offer purchases by the Customer, thereby reducing
Customer acquisition costs for the CSP.
The Use Case is complete when a Customer’s offer is cancelled, and the final charges related to the offer have
been calculated.

details remain in the system until they are automatically archived after a configured period. Automatic
Customer cancellation may also be triggered by a treatment step when the Customer’s debt has been
transferred to a debt collection agency.
The Use Case is complete when the Customer is in a cancelled state and the associated cancellation process
has been initiated.

5.12 GET & STAY READY
The Get & Stay Ready journey covers the system setup activities that CSG will implement to support
<client>’s business processes.
<client> is responsible for maintaining the product catalog which includes offer definitions and pricing, GL
reporting, User/Workgroup administration, updates to Action assignment/escalation, and maintenance of
Currency Conversion rates (if applicable).
Commented [JW184]: Comment from Rick - we should
adhere to GDPR and the right to be forgotten as part of
this UC, I think. Up to the point of leaving, the CSP has the
right to hold the customer’s data, but after than point, the
customer can ask, at any time, to be forgotten. This is
entirely back-end, has no CC involvement, apart from
being able to take the request to be forgotten from the
customer

5.12.1 ONE TIME SYSTEM SETUP (BAS & CONFIG STUDIO?)
To be determined if this section stays in the Solution Description or is split into its own system setup doc
that also has corresponding blueprinting templates.
CSG sets this up on behalf of the CSP and UCs in previous sections use this setup – mix of config and ref
data
Lots of stuff falls into this category
Should not include config that is locked down and not modifiable (as this is not discussed in blueprinting)
Only includes stuff that an implementation team will setup during the project to be CSP-specific (this is
captured in blueprinting)
Possible Use Cases include – lots more to come:
5.12.1.1 DEFINE CURRENCY – SHOULD BE OOTB (FEATURE 479656)
Canadian dollars
Indian rupees
Bulgaria.....
5.12.1.2 DEFINE CREDIT CLASSES
OOTB Values: Low risk, medium risk, high risk
5.12.1.3 DEFINE CREDIT LIMITS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT CLASSES

5.12.1.6 DEFINE TREATMENT ENTRY CRITERIA (FEATURE 480832)
Madalene: It seems like Collections are switched “off” by default, so it will definitely
have to be part of get and Stay ready configuration if the CSP wants it to be switched
on (based on my understanding after today’s setup session).
New feature: release an OOTB example configuration
5.12.1.7 DEFINE TREATMENT EXIT CRITERIA (FEATURE 480832)

Commented [CD185]: Expects an OOTB extension hook
from Product to call out to an external credit agency to get

• Define receivable types and payment allocation rules
A CSP should always specify a system default allocation rule (that is, the Convergent Billing built-in default is the
arrears allocation method that allocates payments/adjustments to the oldest invoice first and according to the
receivable priority within an invoice).  This default should be fixed (that is, not subject to change mid-production)
for the lifetime of the system.
1. The choice of accounting method does not dictate the allocation rule.  For example, if a CSP
supports both balance forward and open item customers, the allocation rule should be specified
as if only open item customers were supported.
5.12.1.15 DEFINE REPORTING ENTITY (FEATURE 479656)
Include a sample OOTB – package with currency and taxes
New feature to assess if we can package individual currencies +reporting entities + taxes, etc.....

agency based on some unique Customer identification details. Typically, the higher the
credit score, the lower the risk. The CSP defines a credit score to credit class mapping,
for example, score >800 = Low Risk class, score 650-799 = Medium Risk, score <650 =
High Risk. The CSP defines a monetary risk value (credit limit) for each credit class, for
example, low risk = $1000, medium risk = $750, high risk = $500. This quantifies the risk
the CSP is comfortable extending to the Customer. A CSP may also wish to exempt
special Customers from the treatment process.
When ordering, the Customer’s credit class may influence which products are available
and when upfront deposits are required to reduce risk. Realtime postpaid authorisation
uses the monetary credit limit to ensure a Customer does not exceed their allowable
risk. When invoices are outstanding, the recovery/collections steps may vary based on
the credit class (i.e. more aggressive steps and/or tighter step durations may apply to
high-risk Customers).
The Use Case is complete when the mapping of credit classes to credit limits is defined
for the Consumer Customer type. Optionally, treatment exempt Customers may also be
defined.

6. GLOSSARY

Term Description
Balance Forward
Accounting
Balance forward accounting combines the previous unpaid invoice amount
with the current balance and refers to this total as the current amount due.
Therefore, there is only ever one outstanding invoice in a balance forward
environment (that is, the current invoice) and amounts do not age as they
are rolled forward into the current period.
The current amount due on the invoice is the total account balance at the bill
issue time.  Any payments/adjustments made to a balance forward account
are used to offset the current amount due.  The CSP only tracks the total
balance and not any previous invoice amounts that have contributed to it.
Interim Invoice
Immediate Invoice
Open Item Open Item accounting is a method where individual financial transactions
(like unpaid invoices) remain as separate, traceable entries ("open items") in
accounts until they are fully settled. Each item maintains its own balance, and
payments are explicitly matched to specific invoices or liabilities rather than
being applied to an overall account balance. This provides precise tracking of
outstanding receivables/payables and enables detailed reconciliation.
Key characteristics:
• Transaction-level tracking: Each unpaid bill or receivable is
recorded separately.
• Clearance-based: Items close only when paid or adjusted to zero.
• Aging accuracy: Aged debt reflects only unresolved items, as
payments directly offset matched invoices.
• Credit notes and debit notes: can be represented as documents
(using the interim invoice functionality)
• Credit notes and debit notes that can be represented as
adjustments (using the standard adjustment functionality)
• Debit notes with aged open balances. Debit notes age as invoices
age; however, credit notes are immediately allocated to open
invoices.  The credit note itself is closed (using a zero value
adjustment) and the funds are allocated as per the default allocation
rules (arrears).
Contrasts with balance-forward accounting, where payments reduce the
oldest debt first without invoice-level matching
CSP Communication Service Provider. <add definition in here>
Receivable type
Receivable types are Encompass entities used to track the ageing of debt for
groups of similar charges (for example, tax, subscriptions, national, and
roaming charges).  Receivable type functionality enables
payments/adjustments to be allocated to groups of charges for reporting
purposes; however, it cannot be used to determine the GL effect (that is,

Copyright © <DD Month YYYY> CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.Copyright © <DD Month
YYYY> CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 118 of 131

when uploading the <client>'s GL, all charges associated with a receivable
type codes are ignored).  When payments and adjustments are allocated to
an invoice, their amounts are broken down by receivable type.
Different allocation methods can be used to define how a payment or
adjustment is allocated to receivable types either within an invoice, or across
invoices.  CSRs can also override allocation methods.  Although the invoice
contains charges grouped into receivable types, these receivable types may
not necessarily be reflected on the invoice.  The receivable types should be
transparent to the customer who receives the invoice.  It is possible to set a
default receivable type that is used to allocate any amount of an invoice that
was not associated with any other receivable type via a tariff or subtotal.
Split receivable Split receivables provide a method of allocating partial payments to a group
of charges on an invoice.  For example, if regulations state that local and
taxation charges are to be the first items to be paid in an invoice, a Customer
payment is allocated specifically to these items.
CCS Converged Charging System
Add definition
TLO An Encompass-specific acronym for Top Level Offer. This is analogous to a
Go To Market offer. The TLO is the main offer that a Customer purchases and
within the offer there are mandatory standard items and optional items (addons) that can be ordered at any time.

• The ability to scale the application's production environment to match the transaction
processing needs of any size of organization
2.2 ENCOMPASS COMMERCE ENGINE
In today's telecoms market, it is essential to be able to reduce the distinction between prepaid
and postpaid, and offer the same level of services and credit management regardless of the
method of payment. This is only possible with real-time interaction with the network, as
delivered by Encompass Commerce Engine.
Encompass Commerce Engine offers:
• A common highly scalable transaction charging framework for all types of accounts, for
example, prepaid, postpaid or hybrid. All types of accounts are managed in the same way:
the account's policy determines whether a service is restricted. This gives complete control
over how to market services
• Interactive and real-time service authorization and accounting to limit fraud and other
revenue loss
• Flexible subscriber policy management, performing service information-based credit
control
• Concurrent account usage - allows multiple devices and services to draw on the same
account, providing opportunities for attractive, flexible offerings
• Dynamic account selection - enables customers to add charges to an account of their
choice
• Customer controlled policies - customers can specify service and account-specific spending
limits and notification preferences
• 'Advice of charge' - customers can determine the price of an item or service before they
incur the cost
• Real-time rating – for revenue assurance and processing efficiency
• The ability to eliminate any single point of failure of the balance manager when installed
with a highly available architecture
• Flexibility - all customers can be offered the same level of service regardless of the
method of payment
• The ability to also integrate with external balance managers, for example, to provide realtime rating capability with an external Service Control Point (SCP)
2.3 ENCOMPASS CUSTOMER CONNECT AND CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT
Encompass provides two CSR user interfaces: Customer Connect and Customer Management.
Both are described in this document. In general terms:
• Customer Connect – Provides greater out-of-the-box functionality, is centered more on
configuration rather than customization, and provides a more upgradable
infrastructure. However, as an OOtB product, the level of customization and adaption
is necessarily less than that found in Customer Management
• Customer Management – Provides a CSR UI framework which can be developed to
implement support for very specific pre-existing business processes. However, as it is
a framework, it involves more business analysis, specification, customization and has
less upgradability potential.
Typically, CSPs with legacy processes which cannot be changed would select Customer
Management whilst CSPs looking for rapid deployments leveraging OOtB best practice would
select Customer Connect.

3. ENCOMPASS SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
This chapter introduces the Encompass architecture and describes the design purpose and
advantages of the Convergent Rating and Billing, Customer Connect and Commerce Engine
modules.
3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ENCOMPASS ARCHITECTURE
Encompass offers a best-in-class customer management and billing platform on which
organizations can build their business. Encompass's unprecedented combination of flexibility
and performance is founded on innovative architecture. This architecture delivers a preintegrated customer management, billing and commerce solution, optimized for performance,
functionality, and business process support.
Encompass's modular architecture means that its components are available as an integrated
solution, or as individual components. This modular format enables selection of the required
modules when they are required. Encompass can be implemented in its entirety, in parts, at
the same time, or in stages.
3.1.1 ENCOMPASS DESIGN GOAL
The Encompass design goal was to create an application that makes no (hard-coded)
assumptions about how you want to do business; including the processes, the services
provided, and how revenue is generated and collected for providing those services.
Encompass's n-tier architecture delivers almost unlimited power into your hands, without the
need for recourse to an external party for customized system changes.
At the heart of the Encompass design are two key concepts:
• The separation of core functionality from configuration
• The Transaction Engine (TRE), with its powerful use of business rule flexibility, which
enables the separation of core functionality from configuration

Figure 2: Encompass: built around a single customer database
3.1.2 ENCOMPASS TRANSACTION ENGINE
The Encompass Transaction Engine is the architectural heart of Encompass. It manages
transactions end-to-end in real-time or batch mode in accordance with configured business
rules.
The Transaction Engine offers:

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 15

• Industry standard architecture, relational database technology, and interfaces to ensure
portability across operating platforms
• Comprehensive security features to provide control of access to customer information
• Support for international implementations including double byte and Unicode character
sets
• One solution to meet all transaction processing requirements, regardless of product,
service, delivery network, customer type, or payment method
The ability to offer new products, services, or simply support an ever-increasing volume of
customers and transactions.Encompass Single Customer Database
Whether only the mandatory Convergent Billing component, or the optional Commerce Engine
or Customer Connect components are also used, the same underlying database is used. This
means that there is no need for integration or synchronization with separate databases for
CRM and Billing - so one set of customer, service and product catalogue data that is shared by
all components – giving the same single view of the customer from a single database.
3.2 DESIGN STRUCTURE
The following diagram illustrates the Encompass functional design.

Figure 3: Encompass functional design
3.2.1 ENCOMPASS CONVERGENT BILLING USER INTERFACE
This user interface can be used to capture and process data relating to the following key
system entities where Customer Connect is not used:
• Customers
• Products
• Accounts
• Services
• Equipment

The Convergent Billing Administration interface is targeted at back-office staff including IT and
operations. The Customer Connect interface is targeted at front office staff including Customer
Service Representatives.

3.2.2 BUSINESS RULE CONFIGURATION
All of your customer management and billing-related business rules (for example, the service
definitions and charging models in the product catalogue) are built from configurable business
rules.
There are two key aspects to this configuration:
1. Best Practice design patterns, codepacks and solutions
Encompass's Best Practice program deliverables provide pre-designed implementations
of common business processes, such as cross product discounting, receivables
management, collections, and treatment. These solutions provide efficient, well-tested
starting points for configuration deployment.
2. Client-specific configuration business rules
Client-specific configuration supports business practices that are unique to your
organization, without the risk, expense, and delay of source code modification.  The
Encompass system is fully configurable, allowing for distinctive pricing models and
Customer Connect processes to become the differentiating factor for the customer and
the market. In a rapidly changing business environment, client configurability means
that these models and processes can be adapted rapidly and economically.
3.2.3 CORE FUNCTIONALITY
Key functionality for customer care, rating, billing, and workflow are contained in the
Encompass core software. This core software is comprised of the components essential for
Encompass to function. Core software can be upgraded without loss of the business rule
configuration.
Core software is optimized for performance and scalability. Since business rule changes do not
touch core code, performance is not compromised as business processes evolve.
3.2.4 TRANSACTION ENGINE (TRE)
The TRE layer resides on the server, forming a central point of coordination, access, and
functionality to ensure processing speed and data integrity.
The design of the configurable TRE engine, as the interface point to server processes, provides
fundamental scalability advantages as it is possible to replicate and distribute incrementally
across the hardware and software IT infrastructure during growth.
Open, published APIs create comprehensive and extensible points of access for third party
applications.
Transactions, whether externally or internally generated, are passed to the server processes
by the TRE as normalized events and are processed through standard rating and billing.
3.2.5 DATABASE
The Encompass Oracle database has been designed to execute with optimal efficiency and
throughput.  Encompass can support the use of either Oracle Enterprise Edition or Oracle
Standard Edition (with certain limitations).
3.2.6 MULTI-TENANCY
Encompass multi-tenancy enables a single Encompass instance to support multiple client
organizations (tenants) by separating tenant-specific data and configuration. For example,
tenants can be:
• Separate companies
• Business divisions of the Encompass customer

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 17

• A combination of the above

The implementation of Encompass multi-tenancy functionality can drive both cost savings and
operational efficiency. Each tenant has limited configuration ability and views and interacts
with the system as if they are the only tenant.  In the Encompass multi-tenancy model:
• Security, reference data, and product offers enable tenants to define their own pricing and
product offer combinations independently of other tenants
• No tenant can view or grant the ability to access tenant-specific instance data (for
example, customer data), or tenant-specific configuration, of another tenant
• The majority of Encompass configuration is shared by tenants, to which they have readonly or no access
• Shared configuration is centrally managed and business data can be made tenant-specific
• Tenants can have their own branded look and feel within Customer Connect
• Tenants can create and maintain their market offers using Business & Administration
Studio
3.3 THE POWER OF EXPRESSIONS
Expressions in Encompass are a method for capturing business rules at many possible levels of
complexity.
Expressions are used to configure Encompass to ultimately affect the way the application
appears to a user and how it functions according to an organization’s business requirements.
They calculate values, define processes and actions to perform, specify test conditions and
defaults, and perform validation. They are also used to control the appearance and
functionality of Encompass GUI forms.
3.3.1 BENEFITS OF EXPRESSIONS
The benefit of expressions is that business rules can be captured and configured in Encompass
without having an impact on the underlying core code.
Encompass's expression-based technology reflects a balanced approach. The expression
language (EPM) is intuitive, easy to learn, and exhaustively documented. It was purpose-built
to support billing and customer care operations, so the performance of expressions
considerably exceeds that of other alternatives. The higher level, script-based nature of
expressions means that less technical, more business focused users can configure the system.
This means that organizations can reduce or eliminate the need for a team of programmers to
support business rule changes, which is generally what is required with other systems.
Encompass's expression-based design encourages on-going incremental evolution of the
system in a low cost and low risk process. This allows dynamic response to market conditions,
and new products and services.
Key benefits of expressions are:
• They are an easy yet comprehensive method of capturing business rules
• They enable personalization of user screens and data access
• They enable quick reaction to customer and market changes
• The application logic is kept separate from core code
• Rules can be dynamically driven and date effective
3.4 CONFIGURING ENCOMPASS AND MAINTAINING REFERENCE DATA
3.4.1 BUSINESS DATA MANAGEMENT USING BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION STUDIO

maintain their go to market offers and other reference data that is held in tables and lists.
3.4.2 CONFIGURATION STUDIO
Encompass Configuration Studio is an Eclipse-based integrated development environment
(IDE) with Encompass-specific functionality incorporated alongside standard Eclipse-based
functionality.
Configuration Studio delivers capabilities with modern IDE efficiency enhancement tools, such
as real-time syntax checking, configuration formatting, configuration completion and advanced
search. Configuration Studio is used to add and maintain client specific business rules
including expressions.

Figure 5: Encompass Configuration Studio
New entities can be created, existing entities updated, renamed and deleted. Dependency
links between entities can be viewed and explored in order to better understand the overall
configuration of a Encompass instance.
Configuration Studio makes the configuration process graphical and intuitive and also helps
efficiency through syntax checking and debugging tools. Configuration Studio links through to
system documentation in the context of what the user is undertaking to avoid having to locate
documents and search as a separate exercise.
3.5 BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT
Encompass Business Processes Management adds support for the creation and execution of
workflows defined using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). It includes the
Encompass Workflow Engine, which integrates an open-source workflow engine as an
embedded process to provide workflow capability. Business processes are described
diagrammatically using BPMN and run in Encompass Workflow Engine.
The Encompass Workflow Engine in Encompass Business Process Management enables the
following:
• Creation and editing of business processes in Configuration Studio using BPMN 2.0
• Ability to easily start and stop business processes in Encompass
• Ability to easily create tasks in business processes that reliably call functions in
Encompass, with support for passing parameters, receiving results, and handling errors
• Ability to send an asynchronous signal from Encompass to a business process
• Automatic persistence of the state of business processes in the Encompass database
• Automatic capture of audit trails in the Encompass database
• Tracking of the state of individual Encompass work items executed by business processes
by their use of scheduled functions

3.6 INTERNATIONALIZATION
Encompass internationalization capabilities include support for multi-currency, multiple
languages, calendars, time zones, and regulatory rules which support deployment in multiple
countries.
Single, double and multi-byte languages can be used with Unicode supported. Convergent
Billing supports language translation for static client text such as buttons, labels, menus, and
some lists. Customer Connect and Business & Administration Studio support translation of the
GUI into other languages and users can choose what language to use when they login to the
system.
Data stored in the Encompass database can be in different language to the language the
Convergent Billing or Customer Connect GUI is presented in.
Text presented to customers, be it on an invoice, a system generated letter or email or
notification such as an SMS, can be held in multiple languages if required and presented to the
customer using their preferred language if known.
3.7 GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)
GDPR data protection requirements apply from 25 May 2018. These requirements harmonise
data protection laws across the European Union and replace existing national data protection
rules. Organizations must ensure that personal data is gathered legally and under strict
conditions, and remove it when the person to whom it belongs no longer wants it to be
retained.
In Encompass, GDPR applies to personal data relating to an identified or identifiable natural
person.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 22

To comply with GDPR, Encompass:
• Obtains consent from a customer to use their personal data as authorized
• Identifies customers that are eligible for personal data erasure after a period of
inactivity
• Erases personal data upon request from a customer
• Erases personal data of customers in bulk
3.8 PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY
Encompass delivers flexibility and freedom while ensuring superior performance and
scalability. CSG benchmarking initiatives have proven that Encompass can:
• Effectively use additional hardware added to the server configuration
• Maintain performance levels and achieve near linear scalability as data volumes increase
• Apply only the processing necessary to implement required business rules
• Provide performance levels consistent with the hardware capability

These results are consistent with CSG customer installations and clearly demonstrate that
Encompass is capable of processing large data volumes. Encompass's n-tier architecture
employs a world-class transaction engine, ensuring a robust, scalable system with high
performance.

Encompass's performance and scalability advantages are derived from its flexibility and its
distributed architecture. Encompass's expression language, by keeping complex business rules
outside the core engine, allows a streamlined core design, optimizing performance.

Encompass uses the Transaction Engine to provide a reliable, scalable distributed On-Line
Transaction Processing (OLTP) infrastructure. This combination provides near linear scalability
for multiple business scenarios, from consumer-based services to complex business offerings.

3.8.1 SUPPORT FOR DISTRIBUTED AND SCALABLE DEPLOYMENTS
Encompass's openness, via its extensible Transaction Engine, allows it to be a Business
Support System information hub. The Transaction Engine manages SOA distributed
transactions and ensures that requests are properly executed. Encompass Transaction Engine
also ensures that transactional load is scaled across available resources efficiently.
3.8.2 HIGH AVAILABILITY
Ensuring constant access to business-critical applications is a necessity in today's 24 x 7
world, and Encompass Transaction Engine components are constantly monitored for
application, transaction, network, and hardware failures. If a failure occurs, Encompass will
logically remove that component from the system, where possible, managing any necessary
recovery procedures, and re-routing messages and transactions to surviving components. This
is transparent to Encompass end users and ensures there is minimal disruption in service.
Manual intervention can be required for batch processes, to determine if the process should be
revoked and rerun once the failure is resolved, or whether processing can be moved to run on
a different component.
Encompass High Availability can be provided for Convergent Billing, Customer Connect, and
Commerce Engine implementations. Two options are available to manage Encompass’s
application high availability:
• Pacemaker - an open-source high availability resource manager, for cluster
implementations,
• Containers and Kubernetes – utilizes Kubernetes to deploy and manage a cluster of
Encompass application servers

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 23

Regardless of which of the above options is utilized, Commerce Engine session continuity is
additionally supported by Remote Dictionary Server (Redis), an in-memory data store
managed in Encompass by interface definitions The Interface provides option to restrict access
to the data stores which can prevent security vulnerabilities if the port is exposed to an
unsecured network, such as the public Internet.
In an active-active high availability implementation, each node processes part of the load, and
a load balancer is used to direct external network traffic to any available node. On a planned
or unplanned failover, the load from the inactive node is distributed to the remaining active
nodes.
Encompass can also utilize Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) or Oracle Data Guard to
support fast fail-over of the database management system in the case of failure of the node
running the active Oracle instance. It should be noted that RAC is not currently supported in
many public clouds today where Data Guard would be used in its place.
Encompass can be deployed as a highly available cluster across multiple geographically
separated locations. By configuring a quorum device and heuristic commands, Encompass can
direct Pacemaker to fence the site evicted by the database manager during network
connectivity loss in a stretch cluster deployment. This enables Encompass to continue to
function as a cluster of servers located on one site. Encompass also supports cluster rolling
upgrades for minor releases.
3.8.3 DYNAMIC WORK BALANCING
Encompass balances its workload across all available resources to ensure that they are evenly
used, whether the services are on the local server, or distributed in a clustered environment.
3.8.4 RESOURCE EFFICIENCY
Flexibility in how and when transactions are processed is a necessity for distributed and tiered
solutions. Encompass's tiered layers build on the Transaction Engine’s queuing to allow intertier communication in an asynchronous, 'connectionless' fashion.
3.8.5 ASYNCHRONOUS EVENT BROKERING
Encompass's Transaction Engine components use a transactional event system based on
publish-and-subscribe programming, to provide communication channels for server processes
to communicate to users. It allows for posting of system or application events that can be
subscribed to by any authorized client, server, or application component in the system.
3.8.6 OPEN EXTENSIBLE API DESIGN
Encompass's extensible APIs and component-based design enable it to blend seamlessly into
legacy Operational Support System and Business Support System environments.  Encompass
provides the flexibility to integrate any additional functionality that is required.
3.8.7 APPLICATION MONITORING
Application monitoring of Encompass provides key information, from real-time data through to
statistics for future system planning. This information also assists in providing effective
benchmarking and problem isolation in the production environment. Operating system,
Transaction Engine and database statistical data can also be collected for gathering
configurable statistics.
Encompass includes tools for comprehensive application monitoring:
• GetStats triggers the collection of statistics on demand, enabling the investigation of
running processes in detail. GetStats is a script invoked from the operating system
command line and displays the statistics immediately on the screen.

• Real-Time Monitor (RTM) performance monitoring is important for Commerce Engine
real time network-integrated rating and balance management processing. Commerce
Engine has a comprehensive RTM capability, supervising 16 separate operational metrics
collected from Encompass, the Transaction Engine, and the operating system. Alarm
triggers and actions, metric collection intervals, and the logging options for the resulting
data are fully configurable. The RTM GUI displays a dynamic "moving" viewport of
statistics in real-time.

Figure 7: Encompass Real-Time Monitor
• Performance Explorer enables the collection, analysis and reporting of historical
application performance data. Statistics are aggregated over day, month and year for
investigations or analysis of long-term trends for proactive resource planning.

 Figure 8: Encompass Performance Explorer
• Encompass Monitoring captures statistics for various Encompass modules and logs them
into Elasticsearch using REST calls. It enables secure communications with Elastic search
using the HTTPS protocol. These statistics are used to visualize various graphs for
monitoring. Kibana is used for visualizations and various pre-created Kibana visualizations
are delivered as part of the Encompass Monitoring solution.

4. ENCOMPASS CONVERGENT RATING AND BILLING FUNCTIONALITY
This section details core functionality provided as part of Encompass Convergent Rating and
Billing (commonly referred to as “Convergent Billing”).
4.1 CUSTOMER CARE GUI – BACK OFFICE
The GUI provided as part of Convergent Billing is targeted at back-office CSRs and billing
operations staff, with the majority of configuration activities undertaken using Configuration
Studio. The GUI does support customer care activities, allowing customers to be added and
products sold to them but most organizations choose to use the Customer Connect module to
do this or an external CRM system which is then integrated with Encompass.
Every task performed in Encompass can be accomplished via the menu items and forms
presented in the main window. Encompass uses standard Microsoft Windows components in its
windows layout.

Figure 10: Encompass Convergent Billing Home Page Layout

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 26

Using the security facilities, System Administrators can ensure that the main window provides
access only to the features the user needs.
Modes of operation
Forms are used within Encompass to search for, view, create, edit, and delete data. For
example, forms are provided to:
• Create products and tariffs
• Record customer details and queries
• Make payments
• Create tasks and reporting schedules

Icons
Encompass makes use of various icons for ease of recognition and to accelerate user activities.
It is easy to design and create specific icons to represent services, equipment, queries, and so
on. Basic icons can be built within Encompass using the Create Icon Tool, or more complex
icons can be easily imported from external graphics packages.
Drag and drop
As the name suggests, the technique of dragging and dropping allows the user to select an
icon, drag it to a new location, and then drop it. This technique is used to:
• Create a new customer, or a new node within a customer hierarchy
• Assign a product to an existing customer
• Create a new query for an existing customer
• Re-organize the relationship between customer nodes
• Move an assigned product between customer nodes

On-line help
On-line help is available in the form of:
• The On-line Help System, which provides access to task-based help, reference
information, glossary of terms, examples, and demonstrations
• Form help associated with each form
• Context-sensitive help associated with each form field and control
• Hint text associated with each form field and control
• Help on Confirm window options
• Help on error messages

The On-line Help System has been designed to provide information to suit the needs of many
types of Encompass users. It consists of the following fully integrated and linked suite of help
components, together with a number of navigation aids that allow the user to move between
and within help topics:
• Task-based (procedural) help that provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform a
specific task, with links to reference information relevant to the task
• Reference information to assist users new to Encompass in obtaining the knowledge
required to use Encompass effectively and efficiently
• Full text search and keyword (index) search facilities to locate information in the help
system
• Examples and demonstrations, to show by example how to perform some of the more
common Encompass procedures
• Glossary of Terms, which defines each of the terms used in Encompass
Searching capability

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 27

Encompass provides a comprehensive and powerful search capability that allows the user to
specify one or more search criteria on which to perform a search. Some search windows also
allow the user to specify one of three search methods: exact match, SQL, and wildcard, with a
clickable Soundex option.
Typically, the data records returned by a search are presented in a list; a specific data record
can then be selected and its details displayed. Many of the search forms in the customer care
environment also provide an option that allows the details of a record to be displayed
immediately if only a single data record is returned by the search.
Screen modifications
Encompass can be modified to allow additional information to be captured in fields and
configurable tables. This can be completed by your staff via configuration without the need to
code.
Data validation (field, form and database level)
Encompass has the following layers of entity validation built into the system:
• At the field level, you can specify drop-down lists of valid values or can include validation
rules that are triggered before the user moves into the next field. Inter-field dependencies
can also be specified to filter the available options in one field based on the data entered
in a previous field
• At the form level, you can enable checks to be triggered, additional data to be derived,
related data to be populated in other tables, and so on, before the record(s) is saved
• At the database level, you can specify the unique integrity constraints and any postcommit triggers that should be fired
All of the above, combined with the user-specific security profiles, ensures that the data stored
in the system is accurate and reliable at all times.
Customer types
Customer types are used by Encompass to segment the customer base. The benefit of
segmentation includes the ability to gather information specific to the type of customer and to
configure charges based on customer type. You can create new customer types to suit specific
market requirements. Customer types can be used as criteria for the format and appearance
of the fields that appear on the customer care desktop form and to specify the default values
and mandatory fields on that form.
Supporting mobile services offerings, Encompass includes a convergent customer model, in
which a single customer can have prepaid, postpaid or hybrid services (that operate in both
prepaid and postpaid modes).
Customers
A customer is the billable entity in Encompass and is often referred to as a customer node.
Each customer can have multiple contacts or persons associated with it, and a particular
contact may be associated with multiple customers. Each customer can also have products
with the accompanying services and equipment associated with it.
Support for customer hierarchies
Encompass allows you to define and work with an account structure hierarchy, known as a
customer hierarchy. Customer hierarchies identify customer nodes that are used to represent
each primary account for a specific billing/reporting point.
Typically, a customer hierarchy will mirror a corporate customer's organizational structure.
There is no limit to the number of levels (or depth) that you can define for a customer
hierarchy as shown in the example below. Similarly, the number of individual nodes in a
hierarchy is limited only by hardware resources. There are production implementations of
Encompass efficiently supporting hierarchies involving millions of nodes, enabling the very
largest corporate customer bases to be addressed.

Figure 11: Example of Encompass customer hierarchies
Customer and Account Model
Each customer can have many accounts used for different purposes, for example, invoice
account, prepaid account, and deposit account. For each level in a customer hierarchy it is
possible to define if an invoice is to be produced or a statement or no billing output. How this
is set will control how Encompass uses an account associated with a customer, as if the
invoice is at a higher point in the customer hierarchy charges roll up to that higher level.
For example, residential customers usually require one invoice for all services and equipment,
whereas a corporate customer may require an invoice for the head office and statements sent
to each branch office.
Encompass supports the sharing of balances, bundles and allowances across multiple customer
products and services as well as between customer hierarchy nodes.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Customer queries
As the first point of contact for most customers, CSRs frequently need to answer inquiries of
all types. Whatever the nature of the inquiry, the CSR needs to access key customer, product,
and billing information in order to serve the customer quickly and effectively.
In Encompass, any customer inquiry that is recorded and subsequently processed is referred
to as a query. Query types can be configured to process work requests for network
provisioning, information for directory listings, notes for a customer inquiry and promises to
pay.
A query that cannot be resolved immediately can be forwarded electronically to a work group
to be resolved. In Encompass, the act of forwarding the query to a work group is referred to
as “progressing” the query. Most queries are automatically forwarded to an appropriate work
group.  Encompass best practices allow notes and promises to pay to remain associated with
the customer account for information purposes rather than being sent to a work group.

Workflow
The progression of a query from its creation to its resolution via one or more work groups is
referred to as the workflow. This workflow ensures that each query is resolved in the shortest
possible time and in the most efficient manner, regardless of the query type.
Queries can be created:
• Automatically, without user intervention. These are typically provisioning, charge, or
treatment related. Pre-defined steps can be configured to dictate the query progression,
together with error conditions and catch-all clauses, or;
• Manually, with some form of user intervention. This could vary from a follow-up phone call
to the processing of an installation order. Manual queries are typically directed to the
appropriate work groups for subsequent processing

Customer history
Encompass automatically captures details of who performed updates, and has built-in date
and time tracking to allow a reliable audit trail to meet standards for data assurance and
reporting objectives.
There are three types of physical records that are stored in the database:
• Historical (past)
• Current (present)
• Future-dated (future)

For example, the site address and/or the postal address of a customer need to be changed
each time they move premises. Each time the record is updated, a new current record and
another historical record are created.
By creating and saving historical records, Encompass allows tracking of when changes were
made to a record and to view a record as it was at a specific point in time. Depending on
access privileges, a historical record can be updated, that is, to backdate changes.
An audit trail of historical data for a customer is available online to authorized users. This
provides the user with customer profile information within the context of the details of their
organization/customer interaction and the business relationship over time.

Order Entry and Management

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 30

Within the sales order process there are two main sub-processes:
• Order Entry – the capture and validation of a customer’s request. It is important that
Order Entry is streamlined to allow customers to make their purchases in an easy, timely
manner
• Order Management – the fulfilment of an entered order, ensuring timely and accurate
delivery to customers. It also encompasses the management of order information, to allow
orders to be searched, updated, and cancelled

The billing, customer care, provisioning, and inventory systems may each play a part in a full
Order Entry and Order Management solution. Robust and efficient integration of these systems
is critical to ensure the successful delivery of products and services to the end customer.
Encompass supports streamlined Order Entry processes and provides options to:
• Deliver an integrated Order Entry, management and billing solution using the Convergent
Billing and Customer Connect modules; and/or
• Integrate to external applications as required
4.2 PRODUCT MODELLING
Encompass allows product models of any size and complexity to be created in this rapidly
changing market. The components that constitute a Encompass product can be mixed and
matched as required to create some of the most innovative customer offerings. Together with
a product offer - a collection of products and other product offers - they allow the delivery of a
package tailored to the specific requirements of a customer. Encompass has the flexibility to
define and make a range of products available, with each providing a specific service or
combination of services. As customer requirements change and new technologies emerge, the
services associated with a product can be modified or deleted, and new services added.
This section briefly discusses the product building blocks that are part of the Encompass core.
Three types of product entities can be defined:
• Product Offers, which are a combination of other product offers, base and companion
products along with rules related to selling, restrictions and pricing
• Base products, that define all of the product components required to offer the product to a
customer.
• Companion products, which are added to a base product to alter the characteristics of the
base product.

Business & Administration Studio is used to define, launch and edit Product or Market Offers
which are built using the underlying base and companion products.
4.2.1 PRODUCT OFFERS
Product offers allow separation of the provision of offerings to customers from the
configuration of the charging rules (products and tariffs) required to support those offerings.
Product offers hide the underlying complexities of expressions and the configuration building
blocks and are designed to be 'marketing friendly' and consequently non-technical staff can
configure these. Each product offer consists of:
• A single base product
• Companion products
• Service restrictions, if required
• Customer type restrictions, if required
• Derived attribute table rows defined for the combination of companion product and
product offer
• Child product offers
• Offer-based charging and entitlements

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 31

Product offers support the rapid introduction of new customer offers which can range from
something brand new to be a minor variation on an existing offering, for example, a new price
or a change to included bundles.
The type of structure that can be created has a top level product offer to which the base
product instance is assigned and then child offers are nested underneath. There is no limit to
the number of levels in the hierarchy. Companion products are attached to the product offer.
When a customer purchases a product offer and child offer(s) it is the base product and
companion product(s) that are instantiated for the customer. This is illustrated below.

Figure 13: Product Offer Hierarchy

If the customer purchases a subset of the product options as detailed below only the
underlying products associated with the product offers selected are instantiated.

Figure 14: Product Offer – Product Instantiation
A customer can have multiple instances of the same product offer, the impacts of this are
dependent on the characteristics of the offer being sold multiple times and whether the offer is
service specific or not.
Encompass permits the storage and use of identical product offer display names for different
product offers by disabling the default unique constraint.

4.2.2 PRODUCT OFFER EXAMPLE
This is an example of a mobile postpaid contract plan which is the top level product offer.
Multiple nesting levels of child offers are shown. The Convergent Billing screen example on the
right of the image below shows the configuration of product offers.

Figure 15: Product Offer Example

4.2.3 BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION STUDIO
In Business & Administration Studio the term Market Offer is used in place of a top-level
Product Offer so as to be more meaningful to a business focused user. A Market Offer is the
package or plan that you sell to a customer. The difference between one Market Offer and
another could be very small making it important to reuse as much product catalogue inventory
as possible. e.g. the price and included data volume GB differ, with all other pieces being the
same or one offer includes multi-play services and others are single services offers.
These pieces in Encompass are the underlying components to pick and choose in putting a
Market Offer together. In some cases, it could be cloning an existing offer and making the
modification, or in others making the new choice part of the existing offer that the customer or
CSR selects as part of the order process.
Whatever the model Business and Administration Studio allows you to build and edit Market
Offers using these components.

Figure 16: Expanded Market Offer with Bundles and Features
When you create a Market Offer these are the components:
• You have to decide what kind of offer it is – the Offer Type (base product).
The Offer Type is a combination of the types of services, equipment, tariffs and pricing
rules for the offer. A category is included that can be used to target offers at market
segments like consumer, SME, enterprise, or segments within these like prepaid or
postpaid

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 34

• You have to include at least one bundle (child offers).
A bundle could exist for each of the different parts of a multi-play offering, and is how a
hierarchy of offerings is supported, with reuse across different Market Offers. In this way it
is possible to quickly and easily create new market offers through reuse of existing
bundles
• You can include as many features (companion products) as are required for the Market
Offer directly or as part of the bundles
• It also provides the ability to trigger validation of market offers individually. This ensures
market offers and related reference data are aligned to customer solutions.
Business & Administration Studio is also used for editing reference data in a user-friendly
manner. Reference data can be filtered and sorted in order to simplify maintenance of data
sets.

Figure 17: Reference Data Editing in Business & Administration Studio
4.3 PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT
Encompass Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) supplies service providers with a method of
developing and deploying their market offers through an organized and controlled framework,
and helps ensure that only tested, authorized, and approved offers are made available to
customers. It supports lifecycle status tracking, offer versioning and Product offer transfering
4.3.1 TRACKING LIFECYCLE STATUSES
Encompass market offers and bundles (child offers) can be tagged with a particular lifecycle
status which can be updated as the market offer progresses through its lifecycle from Design
through to Retired and Obsolete. Lifecycle statuses adhere to TM Forum’s Lifecycle Status
standards and consist of the following:
• In Study
• In Design
• In Test
• Rejected
• Active
• Launched
• Retired/Legacy
• Obsolete
A user’s ability to update the lifecycle status of an offer is controlled via Encompass role
security.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 35

4.3.2 VERSIONING
Encompass PLM also allows for market offers to be versioned. It enables bundles to
automatically add new versions of child offers under the same parent offers. When a user
begins to edit an offer, they will be asked if they would like to have a new version of the offer
created or if they would like to edit the offer in place. If they choose to have a new version
created, the offer’s version ID will be incremented per the configurable incrementing logic.
Display names can be identical across multiple versions of a market offer so that end
customers will not need to see which particular version of an offer they are using.
4.3.3 PRODUCT OFFER TRANSFER
Encompass PLM allows users to import and export versioned product offers in line with Product
Lifecycle Management. The PLM environment type can be configured as either primary or
secondary, with the secondary environment imposing additional restrictions on making
changes to PLM-enabled product offers.Base Product Model
The base product model, as shown below, models a product on a set of component definitions.
Collectively, these component definitions are referred to as the product definition.

Figure 18: Base Product Definition
The product model components are divided into three functional groups:
• Fundamental components
• Costing components
• Selection components

4.3.4 FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS
The fundamental components describe the service types, equipment types, and list
information, if applicable.
The different fundamental components are outlined in the following table.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 36

COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
Service Type A service type defines the type of service offered by a product. For
example, a fixed/mobile telephony product may offer one or more
different service types including:
• Voice
• Data
A product definition must have at least one service type.
Equipment Type Certain service types may have equipment types associated with them.
Note: An equipment type may be a physical piece of equipment (for
example, a telephone), or conceptual (for example, an IP address or a
telephone number).
Derived Attributes A derived attribute is a table allowing data to be stored related to the
product. These tables can be relatively simple, with a single column for
storing frequently called numbers, or more complex, with multiple index
and result columns such as tax exemptions and their corresponding
exemption certificate details.

4.3.5 COSTING COMPONENTS
Costing components include the associated product costs and charging rules. The different
costing components are outlined in the following table.
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
Tariff Tariffs specify the charges to be applied to events associated with a
product instance. A tariff table contains a set of rules to calculate the
amount charged. Normally, a tariff calculates a monetary value, but
may generate other types of charges, such as loyalty points or
duration.
There are different types of tariffs to generate different types of
charges, including activation, usage, recurring, discount (negative
charge), tax, and termination charges.
The amount of the charge generated may be billable and appear on
the customer's invoice, or non-billable and used for subsequent
calculations.
Charge Category A charge category specifies how a charge is allocated for accounting
purposes and is usually associated with a tariff.
At a minimum, the charge category indicates the associated account
type, such as a debtor account or deposit.
Subtotal Subtotals calculate the total (or the minimum or maximum) of all
charges for a particular service or customer.
The value of the subtotal may then be used in subsequent calculations
in the billing process. For example, subtotals are often used in
conjunction with discount tariffs to calculate a discount charge based
on the total usage for a period.
Payment Items
(Base product
only)
Payment items enable upfront payments for a product instance. For
example, to secure roaming data services, a customer may be
required to prepay a $50.00 deposit in addition to their pay-as-youuse plan.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 37

COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
Rating Subtotals Provides the ability to aggregate data at rating time.
Rating subtotals can be accessed from EPM expressions thus making
them available to the rating and billing engines.
Entitlements
(Companion
Product only)
Entitlements are an allotment of units such as, time, bandwidth, or
money that can be consumed by eligible events before charges are
applied to an account. Entitlements can also be referred to as free
units and are typically used to allocate units such as 20GB data as
part of a monthly subscription.
Each entitlement normally has an expiry period in which units are
available to be consumed. Entitlements can also be used to grant
temporary access to specific services.
Entitlement
Sharing and
Associations
Entitlements can be shared, for example, across a family group, or
corporate department which is an efficient way of consuming from a
resource pool of data or anything else. This is typically a customer
grouping in a hierarchy.
It is also possible to share entitlements with any other customer in
Encompass by way of an association. This means sharing of data,
movie downloads or anything with your friends, sports group etc.
4.3.6 SPLIT RATING
Encompass provides the capability to split rate time of day/day of week banded events, when
using any usage charge method that uses time of day bands to determine event charges.
Split rating is a method of charging events when the duration spans two or more ‘time of
day’/’day of week’ definitions. Where time of day is a factor in determining the charge, there is
flexibility to apply split rating across the different time periods.
4.3.7 MULTI-RATING
Encompass also provides the ability to rate events multiple times in one single pass, using
different rating keys and rate tables if required, and guiding the resulting charges to different
accounts. This functionality can be used for both positive and negative charges.  For example,
a single event could result in charges to a customer node, a supplier settlement account, sales
commission, or an advertiser's account.
4.3.8 SELECTION COMPONENTS
Selection components specify how the product is displayed in Encompass and how it relates to
other products.
The different selection components are outlined in the following table:
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
Product Group To ensure that a user can easily find a product, related products
are associated and displayed in product groups. Typically, product
groups are based on the technology of the products within the
group or on market segmentation.
Icon The icon is a graphical representation of a base product within a
product group. It is used on the Convergent Billing GUI to enable
easy visual recognition when associating the product to a customer
by 'drag and drop'.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 38

COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
Product Offer Provides a selection of mandatory and optional companion products
and child product offers available with the base product.
Product
Compatibility
Defines the companion products that can be added to a product
offer associated with a specific base product.
Unlike base products, companion products cannot exist by
themselves and cannot be assigned individually to a customer.
They are only sold as part of a Product Offer.
4.4 COMPANION PRODUCT MODEL
Companion product definitions can be added to a base product to alter or modify that product.
The companion product model is also made up of three component groupings:
• Fundamental
• Costing
• Selection

The facility to create a companion product allows tariff and subtotal definitions to be added so
that they can be used in conjunction with those in the base product. For example, if a discount
tariff is added, the charges calculated as a result of applying the base product tariffs can be
changed.

Figure 19: Companion Product Definition
4.5 CONTRACTS
Special terms and conditions can be applied to a set of products and services for any customer
by using contracts. A contract can affect a base product and by extension a product offer. The
contract functionality enhances the Product Administrator's ability to design flexible products
by enabling features such as:

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 39

• Products at a discount price for a specific period of time.
• Negotiated prices for specific products for an individual customer.

For example, a twelve-month contract could be defined to offer a discount to large corporate
customers on mobile calls if a certain level of usage is reached for their fixed services.
4.6 DISCOUNTS
The Encompass Best Practice guidelines provide for rapid configuration of a set of predefined
discount types. The discount types are named to define the attribute quantified that
contributes toward the threshold stated. The following table details the six discount types.
ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION
Number of calls Quantity of eligible events.
Volume Aggregation of Volume# field on eligible normalized events.
Duration Aggregation of Duration# field on eligible normalized events.
Total charge Aggregation of charges generated on eligible normalized
events.
Hierarchy Aggregation of charges generated on eligible normalized
events but distributed proportionately amongst the
customer’s hierarchy structure. These proportions are stored
in the General tab on the Customer Detail form.
Contract Attributes are contract specific.

Each of these discount types is then split into two mutually exclusive discount eligibility types
described in the following table.
ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION
Preferred
Customer
These discounts are calculated on a per-customer basis. A
preferred customer (PC) is identified as a customer node
whose VIP field is set to ‘yes’. Tariffs, subtotals, and derived
attributes specific to PC discounts contain the acronym PC
within their name.
Market/
Customer Type
These discounts are calculated on the market and customer
type. A non-preferred customer or market/customer type
customer (MC) is identified as a customer node whose VIP
field is not set to ‘Yes’.  Tariffs, subtotals, and derived
attributes specific to MC discounts contain the acronym MC
within their name.

Encompass also provides other discount scenarios not described above through the flexible
configuration of tariffs that determine and generate the resulting discount value.

4.7 PROCESSING EVENT FEEDS
Encompass is designed to bill for any possibilities, as it does not make assumptions about
what an incoming event should look like. In order to load multiple types of events into
Encompass, a translation Data Interface Language (DIL) specification script is required.  The
DIL specification applies syntax rules to interpret the incoming data in terms of data types and
sequence structures. Records are delimited and parsed into the constituent fields used, and
are recognized by Encompass. This process is called event normalization.
Event handling processes can be varied according to:
• Switch/server/mediation vendor
• The source of the events processed by the event normalization process. External sources
may send events in a file, or they may come via a TCP/IP socket from a remote host in
real-time. External sources may include telephony switches, mediation devices, and other
billing systems
• Industry standard used (for example, the Telcordia AMA standard, ASN.1 format, or the
TAP3 roaming format)
• Encompass internal events (NAT format)
• The internal events from the Billing engine. These are rental and adjustment events that
come in the NAT format
4.8 RATING
Rating is the process in which normalized event records are rated (priced) to produce charges.
Normalized event records are created by event data being converted into a standard record
format.
All rating is performed by the rating engine, which allows the construction of charges based on
service data, as well as event records.
The key to the rating engine is its power and flexibility, which allows complex tariff regimes to
be handled easily and new products and tariffs to be introduced quickly and efficiently.
Another important aspect of the rating engine is the ability to apply more than one tariff to the
same normalized event record. This technique, known as parallel tariffing, makes it possible to
apply separate tariffs that calculate charges to customers, commissions, taxes (such as VAT or
GST), general levies, competitor's tariffs (for bill comparisons), and loyalty points. This
technique greatly simplifies event record processing, as each event record requires only a
single pass through the Rating engine. In addition, it provides simpler, more effective auditing.
The rating engine is also used to calculate charges for recurring events, such as line and
appliance rental. Charges are applied in real-time, for example, periodic, activation and
cancellation charges, ensuring account balances are always correct.
To improve the efficiency of rating activities, Encompass allows multiple event files to be rated
at the same time.
4.9 REAL-TIME RATING
Encompass provides real-time rating of voice, data, content and commerce services, creating
a common, flexible, transaction charging framework across any network or service platform.
The Convergent Billing module performs real-time rating of completed events. The Commerce
Engine module extends this to handle network integrated real-time rating including rating
before ('advice of charge'), during (authorization) and after (charging) the call/session.
Cached aggregations are used to provide real-time information on account balances. These
subtotals are used at rating time to determine unbilled usage charges and for the
configuration of other flexible charging plans. This same pricing functionality can be applied at
rating time, after the event, in post-billing batch or streaming environments, in a truly
convergent manner.

Encompass allows real-time account balances for invoice nodes to include unbilled usage for
all child nodes in the hierarchy. This will allow tight control to be kept over the liability risk and
expenditure of the customers.
4.9.1 EXAMPLES
The following are examples of pricing functionality that can be offered with Encompass realtime rating.
Entitlements
Entitlements, or free units, are blocks of included usage offered as incentives to current or
new customers, to encourage subscription to a particular service or package, or to encourage
usage. Entitlements can apply to any type of service that incurs usage charges.  A charge can
apply for the entitlement which is applied in real-time.
Entitlements can be:
• Bundled as a part of a package or offered separately
• Associated with a particular service or to multiple services across a customer hierarchy
Examples of entitlements are:
• Free minutes for voice calls, could be 500 or unlimited
• An amount of GB of high speed data usage, which reverts to a lower speed when
consumed
• Application specific data packages, e.g. discounted or free Facebook or Netflix
• Time-based included usage, such as free data for 1 hour or 1 day
• Free downloads for movie purchases if unable to stream

Example showing control of pre-paid recurring entitlements
A pre-paid customer who signs up for a “football highlights” offer for $10 per month receives
access to premium football content. Each month, Encompass grants a new allocation of
“football highlight content access” and attempts to charge $10 to the customer's account. If
there is a sufficient available balance, their access continues uninterrupted. However, if they
have insufficient balance, their content access is disabled.  If five days later they apply a $20
top-up, then Encompass automatically charges the $10 access fee, re-enables their access to
the football service, and records the date for the next monthly access fee charge.
Tapered or tiered charges and discounts
Tapered or tiered charges and discount schemes are used to encourage high usage of a
particular type of service. Schemes typically consist of either charging less, or providing
discounts when usage reaches specified threshold level(s).
An example of a tapered discount is:
• 1st 100 minutes of mobile-to-mobile calls are charged at $1/minute
• 2nd 100 minutes are charged at 90c/minute
• 3rd 100 minutes are charged at 80c/minute
Budget control
Certain services such as sports, gaming, video downloads, and multi-media messaging may
attract high usage. Budget control is a method of limiting the actual spend on elected usage
types. Customers or users can control their spending on certain services by specifying a limit
applicable for a certain period.  These limits can be defined either through self-care (through
handsets or web interface), or via customer support. When the budget limit is reached, a
specified action will result (for example, send notification and bar the service). This can also
be used to enforce data roaming limit rules and bill shock rules from the EU or FCC regulators.
An example of a budget limit for a bundled product that includes movie and sports services is:

• €20/week cap on Netflix downloads
• €30/month cap on sport video streaming

4.10 SCHEDULED FUNCTIONS
Scheduled functions provide a mechanism for configuration (EPM) to trigger an action in
Encompass or an external system at a future date and time.  Scheduled functions can be
considered a lightweight “one -off task.” They are used extensively by entitlements for the
management of recurring allocations and for issuing notifications when allocations are about to
expire.
Scheduled functions provide support for the configuration of retry periods and retry limits on
failure. There is also a Scheduled Function List form provided for the management of
scheduled functions, allowing for errors to be examined and for failed scheduled functions to
be rescheduled in bulk after error conditions have been resolved.

Figure 20: Scheduled Functions List

This means a customer request to change their address next week or to suspend service when
they are on vacation and reactivate it when they return can be input and the request will be
actioned at the correct time, requiring no manual intervention. Another example that uses
scheduled functions is sending an SMS reminder for late payments.
4.11 BILLING
During billing, the normalized events and charges output by the rating engine are processed to
generate invoice data records, and invoice or statement images.
In many ways, the billing engine is similar to the rating engine in that it applies tariffs to the
input data to generate the output data and supports parallel tariffing, but there are two major
differences.
Firstly, unlike the rating engine (which applies tariffs to individual data records) the billing
engine applies tariffs to aggregated data records. Aggregation means that the individual
charges are aggregated (grouped) into one or more pre-defined groups for the purpose of
obtaining a total value or charge for that grouping. In general, charges are aggregated
according to the pre-defined customer hierarchy so that totals can be obtained for normalized
events, services, individual and child customer nodes, and customers.
Secondly, the tariffs applied to the aggregated records are generally discount tariffs (benefits),
rather than charge tariffs. For example, if a customer's usage is higher than a pre-set limit for
the specified billing cycle, a volume discount could be applied to the total cost of the calls.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 43

In addition to this, it is possible to generate:
• Real invoices, which are sent out to the customer for payment
• Temporary statements, which may be used for quality assurance purposes, or for
customer information
• Interim invoices, to generate a set of charges and produce an invoice for customers in
addition to and without impacting the customer’s regular invoice cycle. This debt can be
aged separately
• Immediate invoices, to enable the generation of an immediate invoice or statement for an
individual customer. This is generated by entering an effective date and time that will be
used by the biller to select the appropriate charges for invoicing. The user is also able to
define whether they wish to process a standard or mock-up bill run. A mock-up bill run will
not apply charges to the customer’s account whereas a standard will. Encompass allows
the generation and viewing of this invoice to be easily accessible to the user

4.11.1 INVOICE ISSUE DATE
Encompass can specify an invoice issue date that is different to the bill run effective date. This
allows charges to be applied according to the bill run effective date. Rental charge start and
end dates can be defined to be different from the bill run effective date.  Aging of the
customer debt occurs according to the date the invoice was issued. This allows for increased
flexibility when running bill runs and applying charges.
4.12 QUOTING
Quoting provides the functionality for Encompass to issue an accurate quote for requested
services, so customers are aware of the cost of their purchase. Organizations can use
Encompass quoting to accurately reflect order pricing, including taxes and discounts, and
generate quotes for existing customers and prospects.
The following are some key features in Encompass quoting:
• Specify prospective customer or select customer information
• Support pricing within a quote including manual price overrides
• Support for multi-currency price lists
• Support quoting for upgrades / downgrades of existing offer
• Quote for customer changes as well as offer changes
• Check offer availability
• Comply with tax requirements
• Utilize standard charging configuration
• Support quoting for multiple consecutive bill periods (pro-rated period and subsequent
normal periods)
• Setting a validity period for quotes
• Easy to convert a quote to an order

Quoting functionality is available via API calls and also within the Customer Connect ordering
and customer change processes.
4.13 INVOICES AND CUSTOMER LETTER CORRESPONDENCE
Since invoicing requirements can vary significantly for each billing implementation, Encompass
provides invoice and letter output in XML format. This allows for that data to be easily
consumed by third party document finishing products to comply with specific functional
requirements.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

4.13.1 SUMMARIZED SECTION OPTIONS AT CUSTOMER LEVEL
Encompass allows summarized invoice sections to for customers.
Examples of the type of summarized sections for event data are:
• Local
• National
• International
• Data Sessions
• Application-specific Data
• VPN Connections

Each customer can select the events to be summarized on the invoice. Where event volumes
are large and subject to a simple per-event charge (for example, SMS messages), it is not
recommended that the details of every event be listed, as this would make the invoice very
long and cumbersome. The customer's choice of summarized invoice sections is set up on a
list 'Call Details Summary' on the customer form.
4.13.2 INVOICE CONTENTS
Invoices (requiring payment) and statements (for reporting purposes only) can contain
summarized information, line by line details, or a mixture of both. For a customer hierarchy,
invoices for payment can be sent to each node, with a statement going to a parent node, or a
single invoice could be prepared for centralized payment, with statements going to the
individual nodes (or other variations on this theme). The 'reporting level' attribute defined for
each customer node controls this feature.
To support line charge details and summarization, subtotals are used for invoice calculation.
Like charges can be totaled for summary display, depending on the configuration applied to
the template. Disparate charges can be keyed (consolidated) to produce summary level
totaling. This enables any charges on the invoice to be related for inclusion into an invoice
subtotal. These charges can be in any currency (including virtual currencies, such as loyalty
points) or multiple currencies. Legal requirements, client business rules, or customer
preference can specify invoice currencies.
Invoice Messages
Invoice messages are used for a variety of purposes.  These may include:
• Statutory messages that must be displayed due to federal, state or local legislation
• Details of promotional plans or offers
• Details of events which will affect the customer (for example, rate changes)
• First bill/welcome messages
• Final bill messages
• Past due messages
Once invoice messages are configured, it is possible to specify the criteria by which a
particular invoice message is selected for display on the invoice; for example, a special
welcoming message for new customers to be printed. There are no marketing messages
delivered 'out of the box', as they need to be unique to each installation and to different
cultures.
4.13.3 DELIVERY MECHANISMS
Encompass produces device-independent XML invoice files. If a customer chooses to receive a
paper invoice the XML invoice files can be formatted by a print vendor for printing.
Users can view the exact invoice image that was printed or emailed to a customer to aid in the
resolution of customer inquiries.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 45

To streamline administration of customer hierarchies, particularly for large corporate accounts,
the selection of the invoice format associated with a given node can be automated. A default
assignment is made, based either on the characteristics of the parent node of the hierarchy, or
the Customer Type of the individual node.
4.14 BILLING OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
Encompass provides two interface options for performing and managing billing operations:
• Convergent Billing GUI
• B&A Studio Operations web-based GUI
4.14.1 DEVICE OPTIONS FOR B&A STUDIO OPERATIONS
The full B&A Studio Operations functionality is available on PC-based browsers:

4.14.2 OVERVIEW OF BILLING OPERATIONS FUNCTIONALITY
Encompass supports a customer (hierarchy) level granularity for all billing operations,
including invoice generation and revoking of invoices.
Customer or hierarchy level billing options include:
• Standard invoice
• Immediate invoice
• Immediate statement
• QA/temporary invoice to aid location of billing problems
• Fast final invoices (keep current or move to new bill cycle)
Encompass provides a single view of all bill runs in the system, both current and scheduled,
with an interactive display of all relevant information. Sorting of bill run information according
to client-defined criteria such as effective date and number of customers is also supported.
Invoices may be suppressed using expressions based on invoice type or other criteria (for
example, suppress invoices with totals less than €1.00, or suppress invoices if the bill cycle is
within one week of customer start date).
Encompass enables the tracing of a normalized event for its entire life through the system,
even if reprocessed, to aid in auditing. For example, this functionality can ensure that events
initially errored out are eventually rated, or conversely those events not requiring rating are
discarded.
Encompass provides a performance statistic infrastructure to aid in early detection of problems
and capacity planning. Runtime performance statistics at functional level are available to aid in
system tuning and effective benchmarking. These statistics may take the form of status
reports or ad-hoc requests. Tools are also provided for maintenance of database partitioning
to significantly increase billing throughput performance.
Encompass allows parallel processing of the generation of invoices, reports and other bulk
output activities to increase the throughput of these activities.
4.15 ROAMING CHARGES AND EVENTS
Mobile network providers need to provide customers with the ability to roam onto other
carrier’s networks and to be able settle roaming costs with other providers.  The GSM
Association developed a specification and file format called Transferred Account Procedure
(TAP) to allow charging information to be transferred between roaming partners while taking
into account currency conversions and taxation. The Encompass solution for handling roaming
charges is based on TAP and covers both rating of events for inbound and outbound roamers,
LTE Roaming, TAP and RAP file support as well as the charge aggregation required to facilitate
settlement.
4.16 TASK MANAGEMENT AND SCHEDULING
Certain tasks need to run in a timely and predictable manner to meet revenue management
objectives. Some tasks also tend to consume significant system resources while running. This
makes system task management a non-trivial consideration for an operations team.
Encompass offers comprehensive options for task management, including these items.
Managing Prerequisites and Incompatibilities
Prerequisite tasks can be defined such that a series of tasks can be run in a pre-defined
sequence. The dependency logic can be quite sophisticated, for example, can branch on
whether a predecessor task has failed outright, or failed under particular conditions. User
intervention can be sought where necessary, using a rich set of notification options.
Incompatible tasks can also be defined.

Representing External Tasks
"Placeholder" tasks can be modelled for the purposes of representing a planned external task,
for example, a database backup.

Managing Resource Usage
The scheduler provides support for controlling task execution based on the resource utilization
of tasks. Encompass also offers the capability to model expected task behavior based on
estimated or maximum duration, i.e., not only what level of resource consumption is
expected, but also its duration.
Notifications and Reporting
The task results queue is monitored for outcome values, or, for when there is no outcome
value after a predicted period of time. Either of these can trigger notifications (e-mail, pager,
etc.) to operations staff.
Encompass represents these options within a graphical user interface (GUI) management
environment, which facilitates easy transition from high-level views (Calendar and Gantt
chart) of multiple tasks to detailed drilldowns on individual task parameters and results.

4.17 RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT
4.17.1 ACCOUNTS SYSTEM
Accounts Receivable is an asset account that represents the total of the amounts owed by
debtors such as customers. It is common that residential customer accounts are tracked using
a ‘balance forward’ accounting method where the current amount due on the invoice is the
total account balance at the bill issue time. Business customer accounts are usually tracked
using an ‘open item’ accounting method where charges on an invoice can be billed, aged,
paid/adjusted or written-off separately.
Encompass supports the following accounting system functionality:
• Balance forward for both primary and secondary accounts
• Unique identifier for each transaction
• Allocation of payments/adjustments to one or more open items

4.17.2 ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
In Encompass, each customer has at least one debtor's account and, optionally, one deposit
account. One or more accounts may be added to these; for example, an account to
accumulate loyalty points. Each account has a unique account number by which it is identified.
Deposits can be stored for customers who meet the criteria specified in the business rules.
This could be for customers of a particular credit class or customers of a particular type.
Encompass best practices allows interest to be calculated on deposit amounts held. Flexibility
in the method and frequency of interest calculation and application of interest to the
customer's account is provided. Interest may be calculated daily and credited to the deposit
account.
A preferred currency can be nominated by a customer or assigned by client business rule to
each account. Payments and adjustments can be made in any currency to that account with
automatic, recorded currency conversion.
Optionally, a customer account can be split into multiple receivable types with each receivable
type associated with one General Ledger Control Account. The generation of sub ledger
reports is supported, for example, Account Receivable Sub ledger and aged debt report, as
well as Deposit sub ledger.
4.17.3 PAYMENTS
Payments represent an amount paid by a customer for services rendered. The payment is
recorded against a specific customer's account, receivable type and, optionally, against one or
more specified invoices (pre-authorized payments do not apply to individual invoices but to
the amounts owing).
Payments can also be created with either a zero or negative amount. This allows for scenarios
where negative balance invoices have been generated and the invoice needs to be reconciled
with a negative payment. This also assists in an open invoice environment where it may be
necessary to associate two invoices using a zero-value payment.
Payments can be made in any currency, regardless of the preferred currency of the customer
account. Payments are converted immediately they are made, and currency conversion details
are held on the payment record. Full support is also provided for virtual currencies, such as
loyalty points.
The two methods of payment entry are 'individual' and 'batch'. Batch payments represent a
set of individual payments of the same payment type that are processed at the same time. For
each of these methods, the set of available payment types (and batch types for batch
payments) needs to be defined.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 49

Individual payments can be input directly into Encompass. It is also possible to integrate to an
external payment gateway to be able to process real time credit or debit card payments.
Payment Types
Encompass best practices provide several pre-configured payment types, some examples are:
• Cash
• Check
• Credit/Debit Card
• Pre-authorized (direct debit from bank account or credit card)

Batch Payments
Batch payment types are used to specify the type of a batch payment; Batch payment types
may reflect the payment types, for example, a check batch payment may be created to record
check payments received by mail. It is more common though to receive payment files from
banks and other financial institutions.
Payment Rejection Handling
From time to time it will be necessary to reject payments received from customers. The
reasons for rejecting a payment may include:
• Insufficient funds in customer's account (bounced check)
• Breach of credit limit on credit card
The rejection reason selected is recorded on the customer account.
4.17.4 ADJUSTMENTS
Adjustments represent any transaction outside of the normal billing cycle transactions
(namely, invoices and payments) that affects the outstanding balance of a customer's
account. An adjustment is recorded against a customer's account and, optionally, against one
or more invoices. An adjustment may be entered individually or in a batch. A batch
adjustment is used to enter a set of individual adjustments of the same type that are
processed at the same time.
Valid adjustment types (and batch types for batch adjustments) are available for selection by
the user.
Adjustments can be made in any currency, regardless of the preferred currency of the
customer account. Adjustments are converted immediately once they are made and currency
conversion details are held on the adjustment record.
Full support is also provided for virtual currencies, such as loyalty points.
4.17.5 DEBIT/CREDIT NOTES
Debit and credit notes are created in Encompass using adjustments with an appropriately
configured adjustment type. When creating a debit or credit note, Encompass allows the user
to enter additional information related to the note and select the document template to be
viewed and printed. The documents are created using Encompass’s functionality for rendering
documents.
4.17.6 BALANCE FORWARD
Encompass supports balance forward accounting. Payments are then applied to invoices in
chronological order starting from the oldest. Adjustments can simply be directed to appear on
the next invoice issued to the customer.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 50

4.17.7 OPEN INVOICE
Open invoice functionality is also available through the flexibility of Encompass. Invoices can
be treated as separate entities, with respective outstanding balances owed. Payments can
then be directed to particular invoices depending on customer request or user allotment.
Adjustments can be handled in the same way with application directed to specific invoices
depending on entry parameters.
4.17.8 SPLIT RECEIVABLES
In support of regulatory and accounting requirements, account balances can be calculated in
user-defined receivable types (or buckets) for application to invoices in a specified manner.
Examples of these types include:
• Basic, which includes POTS/internet access/mobile service charges only
• Toll, for usage charges
• Tax
• Other, catch all

Split receivables provide a method of allocating partial payments to a specified section or
charge group of an invoice. For example, if regulations state that local and taxation charges
are to be the first items to be paid in an invoice and a customer makes a partial payment, that
payment may be allocated specifically to these items.
Business rules for the application of partial payments must be specified. Encompass currently
supports an 'Open Invoice' settlement and account management model where the invoice's
receivable granularity is determined by the invoice item's allocation to a receivable type
grouping. Receivable Types can be configured to hold charges generated by Tariffs and
Subtotals and can assign priorities to them. The Receivable Types can then be used by
Encompass's Payment and Adjustment system to determine which invoice items are paid and
in what order.
Three allocation algorithms are provided. These algorithms are expression based and
completely configurable.
• Direct – Receivable type priority first, then oldest invoice within each receivable type
• Contributory - Oldest invoice first. If a payment cannot fully pay off an invoice, it is
distributed amongst the invoice's receivable types based on the contribution of each
receivable type to the current amount due on the invoice
• Arrears - Oldest invoice first, then by receivable type priority within each invoice

If required, payment and adjustment types can be configured to use one of these algorithms
by default when automatically allocating monies to invoices. In this way, the user does not
need to manually enter amounts against receivable types.
4.18 CREDIT MANAGEMENT
The process of managing and monitoring the financial aspects of the business is vital to their
success. Encompass assists in this process both by being proactive in gathering outstanding
amounts, and in monitoring and responding to credit risks.
The collections or treatment process is configurable based on customer type, credit class,
credit limit, amount overdue and duration outstanding. The system can also be configured on
entry and exit criteria based on a customer’s credit class such as minimum treatment
thresholds to reduce workflow execution costs and definition of credit treatment thresholds to
prevent customers oscillating in and out of treatment in quick succession.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 51

Depending at which stage of the treatment process the customer is, different workflow actions
are generated to assist the CSR in recovering monies. Some steps, such as sending an initial
letter, require no CSR interaction and are automatically generated by the system.  Customer
Connect, or an external CRM system, can be used by CSRs to monitor progress and prompt
them to perform any manual steps required, see section 6.10.11 for more details.
Encompass provides a Schedule Type called "Dunning Letter Generation" that allows
dunning/treatment letters to be generated based on how many days an invoice is overdue and
the amount outstanding on the invoice.
Templates, like those described for invoices, can also be used for the generation of
dunning/treatment letters. Customers with overdue accounts can be selected according to
criteria such as the time overdue and the amount outstanding, and letters based on
customizable templates can be produced to encourage them to pay.
In addition, an enhanced treatment configuration framework is available as part of a packaged
solution. This enables specific treatment and features based on the customer's credit class. It
provides for:
• Defaults and exceptions to treatment rules
• Real-time credit checking
• High use warnings
• Late payment and credit breach penalty charges
• Promises to pay
4.19 GENERAL LEDGER
Encompass provides extensive support for financial reporting, automating the revenue
recognition process, increasing accuracy of the financial reports and providing a fully auditable
solution.
Encompass supports the definition of one or more financial reporting entities, each with a
reporting currency and its own separate general ledger. The general ledger has a hierarchical
account structure and amounts can be rolled up to the parent account level for reporting.
A configurable function guides financial transactions to the appropriate general ledger
accounts, using any attribute from the transaction, customer or subscribed products. Guiding
assigns a transaction to one or more pairs of general ledger accounts, defining the portion of
the transaction assigned to each pair.
Encompass fully supports the changes in state throughout the lifecycle of a financial
transaction, automating the recognition of revenue from accrued and deferred revenue to
actual revenue, as in the following examples:
• A usage event is first recognized as accrued revenue when rated, later recognized as
actual revenue when billed to the customer
• A recurring charge billed in arrears is first recognized as accrued revenue during the
period to which the charge corresponds, later recognized as actual revenue when billed to
the customer
• A recurring charge billed in advance is first recognized as deferred revenue when billed,
later recognized as actual revenue during the period to which the charge corresponds
Encompass maintains an internal sales journal, to which transactions are posted on a regular
basis. Transactions posted to the sales journal include usage charges, billing charges,
payments and adjustments. Encompass supports the definition of financial years and interim
reporting periods. Transactions are posted to the appropriate period according to their
effective date.

An aggregation process calculates the net effects of sales journal entries for later extraction.
The extraction process creates a file with all the transactions to be posted in the reporting
entities financial ledger. The file uses the XBRL financial reporting standard.
Finally, the revenue recognition solution is fully auditable and supports the identification and
correction of any configuration errors.

5. ENCOMPASS COMMERCE ENGINE FUNCTIONALITY
Encompass Commerce Engine (‘Commerce Engine’) provides real-time authorization and credit
control of voice, data, content and commerce services, creating a common, flexible,
transaction charging framework across any network or service platform.
The diagram below is a high-level view of the role Commerce Engine plays in an any pay
environment. Commerce Engine provides a common (transaction charging) framework for SCP
platforms, mobile data gateways, content providers, m-Commerce servers, and other
requesting applications.

Figure 24: Commerce Engine
Commerce Engine enables Encompass's rating engine to be integrated in real-time with
network elements, bringing the flexibility of business rule-driven expressions to real-time and
prepaid systems.
Commerce Engine also enables use of the full power of Encompass entitlements, which provide
the ability to configure sophisticated charging and pricing plans such as free minutes, tiered
charging, and budget control at rating time.
Commerce Engine can also be integrated with a third-party balance management application
in the scenario where the master account balance is maintained in that external system.
5.1 RESERVATIONS AND REVERSE RATING
A reservation is applied to a customer’s account by Commerce Engine to ensure sufficient
funds are available prior to the use of a service. This checking allows credit control decisions
to be made in real-time. For example:  a request for reservation of usage is denied due to lack
of funds. To calculate the monetary amount to be reserved, details such as event information,
customer preferences, charging plan and available balance can be taken into account.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 54

Commerce Engine can be configured to use 'reverse rating' to determine the amount of time
or volume to be allocated for an event. It converts the monetary amount into a token of value
relevant to the transaction.
For example:
• €1 = 1 minute of talk time = 1 token
• €3 = first 3 minutes of MP3 download = 1 token
A reservation moves through a number of stages, beginning with one token and, if necessary,
extending with further tokens.
The reservation stages are:
• Creation
• Extension
• Commit
• Cancel
These reservation stages are described in section 5.5.3.
5.2 VALUE TO TELECOMS SERVICE PROVIDERS
Encompass Commerce Engine provides the only real-time charging solution designed
specifically for convergence. It has the longest and most successful production record for a
fully convergent solution. This means that Commerce Engine enables providers to offer
innovative pricing and payment models to all types of customers.
CSG recognizes that many service providers are facing tough challenges with their current
charging architectures including:
• Increased complexity and cost from separate solutions for prepaid and postpaid customers
and accounts
• Need to launch a variety of new services, and do so in a cost-effective manner
• Ability to offer new charging models is constrained by the current charging solutions
The features of Commerce Engine provide a unique answer to these challenges:
• A single solution for the service provider’s prepaid and postpaid charging needs
• Independent of any network or services technology
• Open and flexible customer, product and charging models
Commerce Engine offers unrivalled benefits to service providers seeking to take commercial
advantage of prepaid and postpaid convergence:
• A rationalized solution architecture to provide immediate impact to CAPEX and OPEX
investments
• Able to accommodate any service or technology that a service provider may wish to
introduce in the future
• Offer innovative pricing models to all customers irrespective of payment model
5.2.1 PAYMENT CONVERGENCE
Protect and grow revenue
Commerce Engine enables existing revenue streams to be protected and grown through
competitive distribution channels, with control over the way the customer pays. This revenue
can also be grown by improving collections and allowing prepaid services to be promoted to a
range of competitive market segments, without any restrictions to tariffing or discounting.

Through Commerce Engine, customers can be treated in the same way and offered the same
services, regardless of their payment method.
5.2.2 REAL-TIME AUTHORIZATION
Commerce Engine offers real-time service authorization to permit the use of a service by a
customer. Many transactions are authorized in non-monetary units, such as when data events
are authorized in kilobytes.
5.2.3 POLICY CONTROL
In addition to service authorization, Commerce Engine offers the ability to implement
additional policy controls including instantiating network policy updates, particularly where
policy rules require complex decision rules, or rating and tracking of balances.
Commerce Engine can be easily integrated with a PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function)
as part of an overall policy and charging (PCC) architecture; with Encompass Commerce
Engine providing the Online Charging System (OCS) and Subscriber Profile Repository (SPR).
The PCRF can be any 3GPP compliant solution.
5.2.4 CONCURRENT SESSIONS
Use of reservations enables multiple calls to draw on the same account concurrently. The
business rules that are used to calculate the reservation for each call or session are designed
to balance the demands of the current session versus the ability to service other sessions
during the duration of the first. Reservations are explained in further detail later.
5.2.5 RESERVATION RELEASE MANAGEMENT
Once a call or session has concluded, the calling system will send a commit message to
Commerce Engine to indicate that the call has finished. Commerce Engine will then calculate a
final charge for the transaction (or use the reserved amount for atomic transactions) and
commit that amount to the customer's chosen account. The reservation open for the
transaction will be automatically cleared.
Capabilities such as tiered real-time pricing schemes, which encourage users to talk longer for
less, were not typically achievable in the IN prepaid environment. This is an example of
functionality readily able to be defined within Commerce Engine.
5.3 REAL-TIME CHARGING
5.3.1 BACKGROUND
Commerce Engine provides real-time authorization of voice, data, content and commerce
services, creating a common, flexible, transaction charging framework across any network or
service platform. Commerce Engine enables Encompass's Rating engine to be interfaced to the
external systems of service and content providers and to process requests for service usage
before and during any event or session.
Encompass 'real-time charging' enables the configuration of sophisticated charging plans. This
functionality enables flexible pricing and policy plans, such as free minutes, tiered discounts,
and budget control. This pricing functionality can be applied at rating time, after the event, in
post-billing batch or streaming environments, in a truly convergent manner.
In order for Commerce Engine to provide real-time authorization and account balance
updates, CSG recommends Encompass be deployed with a highly available active-active
architecture.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 56

Encompass allows real-time account balances for invoice nodes to include unbilled usage for
all child nodes in the hierarchy. This will allow tight control to be kept over customer liability
risk and expenditure.
5.3.2 ENHANCED PREPAID
Encompass removes the historical constraints that exist at many operators of having prepaid
and postpaid customers and accounts billed in separate systems.
Encompass removes this constraint (and many others) and allows the customer to use their
device the way they want to. For example, a customer can choose for their mobile service to
be prepaid during business hours and postpaid after hours. In fact, Commerce Engine
manages prepaid and postpaid services through the use of credit limits, instead of prepaid or
postpaid (that is, any pay).
A traditional prepaid account is defined with a zero credit limit. When the account is 'topped
up' or credited, services can be used until the 'real-time account balance' approaches zero. For
the traditional concept of postpaid, a positive credit limit is established (for example, $500)
and service can be used up until the account balance reaches this defined limit.

Figure 25: Credit Limit Definition
Various warnings and restrictions can be implemented for both types of service as they
approach the credit limits. In assessing the credit limit, the real-time account balance takes
into account all active reservations.
Another example is a child customer having a prepaid account for all services, with emergency
calls and calls to a nominated home number always allowed and billed as postpaid.
5.3.3 CUSTOMER CONTROL
Commerce Engine can be configured to allow customers to control which of their accounts is
used on a per session basis. This may be determined by pre-defined rules such as different
accounts for local versus international calls or on the advice of the customer at the
commencement of a particular session. For instance, a customer may choose for data usage to
be guided to a Business Account during business hours, and to a Family Account outside of
these hours.
Commerce Engine can also be configured to allow customers to request the cost they may
incur for a particular item or service, including rates for volume-based or duration-based
services.
Finally, Commerce Engine can be configured to allow the customer to specify spending limits
specific to a service. For example, a particular mobile phone can be limited to a specified
amount per month or restricted from making international calls.

5.3.4 DECREASE COSTS
Commerce Engine can decrease operational costs by allowing all services to be handled by one
vendor and one platform. Traditionally, prepaid, postpaid and commerce services were
handled in a different manner, as illustrated in the following diagram.

Figure 26: Traditional Payment Systems

Commerce Engine allows all service types to be managed through one system following one
approach. The diagram below illustrates this any pay approach.

Figure 27: Encompass Commerce Engine
In addition to decreasing operational costs, Commerce Engine improves fraud management as
it offers dynamic real-time credit control of postpaid customers.
5.4 FEATURES AND BENEFITS
This section describes the following key features and benefits of Commerce Engine:

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 58

• Common product catalog and transaction charging framework
• Real-time service authorization
• Concurrent account usage
• Dynamic account selection
• Customer controlled budgets
• Advice of charge (AoC)
• Real-time rating
• Flexibility
5.4.1 COMMON PRODUCT CATALOG AND TRANSACTION CHARGING FRAMEWORK
When managing prepaid and postpaid accounts using different systems there is product
catalog duplication and reporting across the whole customer base can be difficult.
Having all customers in one system allows a mixing of types of service offerings including new
types of hybrid services to be offered. All transactions are charged by the same engine with
the credit limit governing whether a service is restricted. With all customer details in a single
system all customers can be offered a similar self-care experience irrespective of how they
pay as the same data for prepaid and postpaid customers is available.
5.4.2 REAL-TIME AUTHORIZATION
Commerce Engine offers real-time service authorization to identify that the service is available
to the customer.
This enables Encompass to control all financial aspects of a transaction before, during and
after the event. It can authorize events before those events occur, check balances throughout
the event, and provide a post rating balance in real-time upon completion of the event, to
ensure up to the second account balance information.
5.4.3 CONCURRENT USAGE
Commerce Engine reservations functionality enables multiple devices and services to draw on
the same account at the same time, without jeopardizing credit limit overruns.
5.4.4 DYNAMIC ACCOUNT SELECTION
Commerce Engine enables configuration of 'dynamic account selection' that allows customers
to control which of their accounts is to be charged for a particular transaction or type of
transaction.
Dynamic account selection may be determined by pre-defined customer-controlled business
rules. For example, different accounts for local calls and data access during business hours, or
by transaction on the advice of the customer at the commencement of that transaction.
5.4.5 CUSTOMER CONTROLLED BUDGETS
With the exciting new services that will be offered by next generation service providers,
customers will demand greater control over their spending and the accounts to which the
spending is allocated within their account hierarchy.
Commerce Engine can be configured to allow customers to specify service and account specific
business rules, including spending limits.
5.4.6 ADVICE OF CHARGE (AOC)
Before making use of a service, a customer may wish to know the cost they will incur for an
item of content, or alternatively the rate for volume-based or duration-based services.
Commerce Engine can be configured to provide Advice of Charge (AoC) information to service
providers’ systems, either before an event, at event setup, or after event completion.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

5.4.7 COMPLEX TARIFFING
Commerce Engine supports complex tariffs and discounts through Encompass’s powerful
expression language and entitlements. Examples of the types of tariffs that can be configured
to operate in real-time include:
• Entitlements, where customers purchase blocks of time or volume (or other units
corresponding to a class of service). Complex rules can be defined such as monthly roll
over rules and expiry limits
• Aggregate based discounting models, for example, 10th call per day is given a 50%
discount
• Earning of loyalty points – use of a service or a top-up results in allocation of loyalty
points. The points could then be used to pay for other services, for example, purchase an
extra data pack

5.5 HOW COMMERCE ENGINE WORKS
5.5.1 ARCHITECTURE AND SERVICE PLATFORM INTEGRATION
Commerce Engine consists of:
• An interface accessed by external systems
• Caches of customer account balances and reservations, service details, product catalogue,
and tariff information. This caching avoids the need for database lookups during
reservation requests
• Encompass rating engines to perform rating of events and ‘reverse rating’ for reservations
(where monetary amounts need to be converted to volume or duration units)
• Business rules configured as Encompass expressions that control the size of reservations,
the account selection rules and customer-specified business rules such as policy logic

Figure 28: Commerce Engine Rating Flow

Commerce Engine is a service-agnostic, interactive revenue management platform that can be
integrated with different types of service platforms, for example:

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 60

• Legacy prepaid systems
For interfacing legacy service-node prepaid and IN-based prepaid customer bases into
next generation account hierarchies
• Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)
For the enforcement of policy rules that are based on tracking of balances and rating of
usage. The PCEF functionality is typically fulfilled by a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) box,
or by the GGSN network node
• Media streaming servers
For automatically processing real-time Quality of Service data generated by media servers
and routers. This may be used to generate credits for customers when streams are
dropped or viewing quality degrades
• Content servers
• Service Control Point (SCP)
Commerce Engine is designed to operate as a cost control function for voice and data prepaid
services. This allows the rating and billing functionality of Encompass to be applied to accounts
in real-time.
5.5.2 COMMERCE ENGINE ADAPTERS
Depending upon a CSP’s network, Integration of Commerce Engine with the service platform is
achieved using the Commerce Engine Diameter (3G, 4G) or HTTP/2 (5G) adapters. These
adapters implement the standards defined by the 3GPP. Since the adapters must integrate
with network service platforms with tight operating parameters, the adapters are highly
performance-optimized. The adapters also have features designed to support their operation
in High Availability environments:
• A High Availability Control Interface supports rapid activation or de-activation of an
adapter instance, to support planned or unplanned failover operations
• If abnormally heavy service loads are encountered, Overload Protection selectively drops
service requests which cannot be successfully processed within the timing parameters of
the network service platform. This conserves system resources for viable requests,
maximizing service fulfilment under high load conditions
Commerce Engine does not manage any physical call connections:
• In voice networks, the service platform is responsible for the management aspects of
event connectivity, requesting authorization from Commerce Engine to set up or
continue an event
• Commerce Engine is responsible for answering requests from the service platform,
evaluating the available balance, applying eligible tariffs and business rules, and (from
this) authorizing or refusing the transaction
The following diagram shows the message flow between Commerce Engine (CE) and the
Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and the Service GPRS Support Node (SGSN) for a
typical data session.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Figure 29: Commerce Engine Reservation Flow
When the caller dials a number, a request is made to Commerce Engine to authorize the
event. Commerce Engine locates the customer account to be charged for the service and then
determines the appropriate token size (duration to reserve) by applying configurable business
rules. It then reserves the funds in the customer's account and advises the IN of the allowed
duration.
For prepaid customers a credit limit of $0 is set. Once this limit is reached the service is
restricted. A service provider may choose to increase the credit limit above $0 according to
loyalty based on customer's spending.
For postpaid customers a positive credit limit is set at, for example, $100 and service is
restricted once this amount is reached. A payment can then be made as required.
5.5.3 RESERVATIONS
Reservation Creation
Once a service authorization request for an event is sent to the customer's account, an
appropriate real or virtual monetary amount is reserved from the account balance and held as
a deposit, and the transaction is allowed to proceed. A reservation will be created for a service
if funds are available. Reverse rating provides time and volume information via a token to the
service platform.
For transactions where the final cost cannot be determined at the start, Commerce Engine
makes an initial reservation (subject to available credit) to enable the transaction to
commence. If the customer's account has insufficient funds to initiate the transaction, the
service request is rejected and the transaction fails.
The following is an example of a reservation creation.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 62

Figure 30: Commerce Engine Reservation Creation
In this example, the Customer Account balance is $120 and each block = $10. A call is placed.
The service platform requests a non-atomic time-based session.  Commerce Engine interacts
with Encompass rating to retrieve a rate and check the rules.
Assuming 1 minute = $10 = 1 token, a token of 1 minute is passed back to Commerce Engine,
which results in the reservation being created.
The token is returned to the service platform and the session is authorized for 1 minute.
Reservation Extension
Once the first token is depleted, another request is sent from the service platform (using
identical rules to that of creation) to extend the existing reservation. Multiple extensions can
be applied to a reservation.
In the example below, note that another reservation is requested as the first token has been
depleted.

  Figure 31: Commerce Engine Reservation Spent
Reservation Commit
Once the service event is complete, the reservation is committed and Encompass:
• Re-rates the event with the exact duration or volume to calculate a final charge for the
transaction.
• Clears the reservation for that transaction.
• Commits this charge to the customer's chosen account, which supersedes any reservation
amount.  The customer's account balance is updated in real-time.
Reservation Cancel
An uncommitted reservation is removed from the account. For example, if a user cancels a
video download, the reservation will be cancelled.
5.5.4 REAL-TIME RATING
Once a call or session (event) has concluded, the system will send a commit message to
Commerce Engine to indicate that the event has finished.
Commerce Engine will then:
• Calculate a final charge for the transaction including any discounts
• Commit that amount to the customer’s chosen account
All reservations open for the transaction will be automatically cleared. That is, the event will
be rated and the account balance updated, with no perceived delay, without having to wait
until an event detail record is received.

6. ENCOMPASS CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT
Encompass Customer Management (‘Customer Management’) provides a Web-based contact
center front-end for CSRs to manage customer interactions from initial communications,
through sales orders, on-going support and all post event or billing enquiries.
Customer Management is built on Encompass Process Engine ('Process Engine') core
technology. Process Engine provides the architectural foundation, and a sophisticated toolset
that enables business solutions such as Customer Management to be configured. It provides a
highly configurable GUI, sophisticated workflow, and direct access to other databases, as well
as expressions (EPM).
6.1 BUSINESS OBJECTS
The major classes of objects managed by Customer Management are:
• Case
• Contact
• Issue
• Action
The attributes associated with the classes (called 'Facts' in Customer Management) may be
extended as part of a deployment project with any number of user-defined facts. Additional
object classes can also be defined to meet business needs.
This unprecedented level of flexibility enables the system to be configured with virtually any
business rule, making no restrictions on marketing, business processes, or customer
interactions. The other great advantage of Encompass is that this configuration is achieved
easily, via a series of tools known as the Configuration Workbench (for more information, refer
to section 6.10.17).
The following diagram shows how these major classes are used during a customer
communication with the organization.

Figure 32:  Customer Management Case Model
Each of the major classes is further described below.
6.1.1 CONTACT
A contact is any person, group, or organization that may communicate with the organization,
either to make inquiries about the products and services, to order products, to raise problems
or any other reason.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 66

Contacts are differentiated by type (for example, business or residential, primary or secondary
contacts), which allows categorization of contacts for use in marketing or product planning.
An unlimited number of contact types can be defined to suit the organization’s business, and
the screen layouts used by the CSR can be configured to reflect the information that is
required for each different type of contact. For example, the organization may want to capture
business and personal email addresses for a business contact, but not for a residential contact.
From the Contact Overview screen image shown below the user can access customer details
and as well as easily navigate to open cases for this contact. Issues and orders can be added
as well as new actions required as a consequence of the call or other customer interaction.

Figure 33: Contact Overview
6.1.1.1 TIME ZONE SUPPORT
Encompass’s time zone functionality allows date-time values for customer related entities to
be stored and presented in a customer’s time zone. Examples include effective dates for
service orders, issue reporting, rentals, payments & adjustments, entitlements & allocations,
etc. This aids both customers and CSRs as it becomes no longer necessary to convert effective
dates for customer related items from system time to the customer’s time zone “on the fly”
while providing support. The functionality is ideal for CSPs whose customers span multiple
time zones or have customer support teams located in separate regions from their customers.

6.1.2 CASE
When a contact communicates with the organization, a new case is created. A case records
the details of the communication, which may include a number of different items including
sales orders, payments, or inquiries raised. These items are referred to as issues (refer to the
section below for more detail on issues).
The ability to group issues raised as a set under a single case is a key feature of Customer
Management. It promotes a single point of contact with the customer by enabling the
organization to resolve any number of issues as a group.
For example, when a customer raises several issues within a single call, a single case is
created which groups these individual issues. If the customer calls back later, the CSR can
retrieve the case and have immediate access to all items discussed previously, and their
status.
A case remains open until all issues in the case are resolved and/or all sales orders associated
with the case have been processed.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 67

6.1.3 ISSUE
An issue represents a topic raised by a customer that requires some form of resolution,
whether this occurs during the call or as part of follow-up activity. Issues are classified by
type.
For example, if a customer has a compliment or complaint, a new issue will be raised to gather
the details, and to assist the CSR in providing the information while the customer is on the
call.
Classification of issues has several advantages:
• It clearly indicates the reason for the customer call
• Different screen layouts are presented to the CSR based on the issue type, which
simplifies their task in gathering the appropriate information and finding a resolution
• Classification allows analysis of the types of issues being recorded, which provides
valuable information for marketing and measuring customer service levels
While Process Engine offers the ability to configure new issue types, Customer Management  is
preconfigured with telecommunications-oriented issues. Some examples of the types of issues
that may be raised include:
• Account balance inquiry
• Dispute an invoice or event
• Adjustment
• Payments
• Orders
• Trouble tickets for a product
• Request for information on a new product line
• Compliment or complaint about customer service
6.1.4 ACTION
When issues are raised, there may be work tasks that need to be carried out to resolve the
issue for the customer. These tasks are called actions. Actions can also be used to record
activity that occurs in the system. Actions may involve something as simple as sending out
information to the customer or it may be a complex procedure required to investigate and
resolve a situation that a customer is experiencing with their service.
Actions are defined to support the organization’s business processes, including assigning
actions to the relevant division, providing a duration and due date for action completion,
escalating incomplete actions to ensure the due date is met and notifying supervisors of action
status.
For further detail on actions and their use in managing workflow, refer to the next section.
6.2 WORKFLOW
Customer Management offers workflow management functionality that supports high quality,
cost effective resolution of complex customer issues by managing the follow-up activities of
the business processes. Customer Management offers the ability to track all customer care
events, regardless of their complexity.
Configurable, automated business procedures, including escalation policy management, ensure
that agreements regarding task deadlines are met. The following sections describe the
workflow functionality provided by Customer Management.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 68

6.2.1 TRACKING SERVICE ACTIVITIES
Encompass tracks all customer care activities, from simple event processing such as 'received
information', to complex business procedures such as service level agreements. Each task, or
action, is assigned to a user whose activities can be managed from their individual to-do list,
or to a workgroup (for more information, refer to section 6.2.2 Workgroups).
Each task contains information such as priority, when it is due to start, when it is due to be
completed, who assigned it, and estimated work required. The power and flexibility of the
workflow functionality offers great benefits to organizations as all of these values can be predefined to meet the business process requirements, or they may be derived from the
customer, case, or other details.
6.2.2 WORKGROUPS
Tasks can be assigned to logical work queues rather than to individual team members.
Individual team members may pick up the next task in the queue by requesting the next
action from the queue, or workgroup managers may assign activities from the queue to them.
Users may be assigned to multiple workgroups, depending on their function. When a user
requests the next action, they are automatically assigned the highest priority tasks on any of
their work queues.
Workgroup managers can be defined to ensure that risk of tasks not being completed by the
due date can be appropriately managed.

6.2.3 ACTION GROUPS
Complex business processes can be broken down into workable sets of related activities called
action groups. Action groups allow complex tasks with dependencies and inter-relationships to
be modelled and managed.
Each individual task in an action group may be allocated to a different workgroup, and can be
tracked and managed independently. The dependency rules ensure that the precedent task is
complete before the appropriate workgroup can start the next task.
Action groups allow divisions responsible for tasks within an organization to guarantee
consistency of customer contact handling by the automatic creation of procedures, based on
the details of the call.
6.2.4 ESCALATION
Encompass helps manage contractual or implied service agreements by ensuring that tasks
are completed in the agreed timeframe.
Each task can be given an escalation policy that defines operations for the system to perform
as deadlines approach.
Escalation operations may include reassignment of the task to a workgroup that provides
second level support or a change in priority to ensure the task is handled more quickly.  These
escalations can be scheduled based on the due date of the task (for example, the first
escalation may occur one day before the task is due to be finished).
It is assured that vital tasks do not 'slip through the net', improving customer satisfaction, and
removing the necessity for users to 'remember' to carry out a task.
6.2.5 NOTIFICATIONS
The primary means of communicating task assignment in Encompass is the to-do list. The
assignee is responsible for viewing their to-do list and completing the actions.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 69

Notifications allow communication of activity to users, workgroup managers or external
contacts. For example, notifications can be sent in the following situations:
• An action is assigned to an individual, so a notification of the assignment is sent to the
assignee.
• An action is at risk of not being completed by the due date, so a notification is sent to the
workgroup manager.
• An action is completed, so a notification is sent to the contact on the case.
• If the intended notification recipient is logged on to Encompass, they will receive either a
pop-up message or email or both. If they are not logged on, an email will be sent. The
notification does not occur if the recipient initiates the event (generally if the Assigned By
and Assigned To users are identical).
The conditions required for triggering can be individually tailored for each action.
Other notification capabilities include:
• Allowing the notification method to be tailored to each action type.
• Specifying individual triggering conditions (see section 6.3 for more detail on triggers).
• Supporting the ability for deployment teams to add additional notification methods, such
as SMS or pager.
These notification features have significant value as they allow the allocation of tasks to a
much larger audience than the CSR group. This includes staff members that do not have direct
access to the Encompass application. The details of the task can be entered into the
notification and a variety of mechanisms can be used to reach remote assignees.
6.2.6 CALENDARS
The system can include several working time calendars. These calendars control due date and
time calculations defining the working day by allowing weekends and public holidays to be
excluded across different regions if necessary.
6.2.7 CORRESPONDENCE GENERATION
Customer Management provides the ability to generate documents based on templates defined
in XML (templates that have been defined in Microsoft Word), TeX, HTML and plain text.
Convergent Billing can also be used to generate documents in a more batch process oriented
manner for correspondence like invoices and treatment letters.
Data values from the relevant case, contact, issue and action, as well as other detailed
information can be merged with the template to produce documents that can be viewed
immediately or printed later. This method of generating correspondence ensures that all
fulfilment is handled consistently and completely.
Email templates can also be defined as XSL files which can also be used for customer
communication.
The types of activity that this functionality is useful for includes:
• Producing covering letters for requested information booklets
• Sales contracts
• Service orders
• Complaints follow up
6.3 TRIGGERS
Customer Management is able to perform operations automatically, based on a particular set
of conditions or on request by the CSR. This functionality is based on triggers, which evaluate
the conditions and perform an operation when the criteria are met.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 70

Typically a trigger condition involves applying pre-defined models to CSR activity to ensure
that business rules are followed.
For example, when a CSR starts to enter data that relates to a specific type of activity, a
trigger may be used to:
• Automatically generate workflow
• Update, create or retrieve data from Convergent Billing
Triggered operations can be used to support activities such as marketing, churn management,
customer satisfaction management, workflow, and quality management.
Triggered operations are a significant competitive advantage as the evaluation of the
conditions that trigger any kind of operations is automatic and real-time. Other products might
support the ability to analyze contact data on periodic or ad-hoc bases. The disadvantage of
this approach is that there is no ability to influence contacts while the customer is still on the
phone, based on rapidly changing circumstances. Customer Management’s triggered
operations methodology helps to ensure a more complete and real-time customer experience.
Customer Management may be configured to automatically trigger searches (including those
on externally-held data), user messages, or activities related to the contact, as they occur,
without intervention from the user. This timeliness can have a marked effect on the quality of
contact management within an organization, improving customer service and increasing call
center efficiency.

6.3.1 USE OF TRIGGERED OPERATIONS
Some examples of how triggered operations might be used in Encompass are described below.
Marketing campaign
An inbound marketing campaign may seek to target customers with particular characteristics;
for example, females aged twenty-five to forty-five living in the northwest region. When a
customer calls, and the CSR has entered sufficient details to ascertain that the customer is in
the targeted demographic, Customer Management can trigger the display of a web page (for
example on the corporate intranet) that provides the CSR with relevant information about the
campaign.
Sales reporting and triggering
On a regular basis, the system checks sales figures for the period. If they fall below a defined
threshold for a team, Customer Management can send an email to the team leader.
Trouble ticketing
A CSR receives a call regarding a mobile phone call dropping out. Customer Management
recognizes that there have been ten similar calls for the same base station in the northwest
region within an hour and sends an email to engineering.
In this case, the threshold has been set up as ten or more calls in one hour. On the eleventh
call, the CSR is notified that an engineer has been dispatched so they can inform the caller
accordingly. In more complex cases the triggered operation may be configured to notify the
CSR of the expected turnaround time for the problem to be fixed. This degree of proactivity is
key to reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction.

Churn management
A customer complains about service quality. Customer Management identifies that this
customer is at risk of churn due to three previous complaints about service and a trend of
falling usage. The CSR is immediately prompted to offer the customer a discount for a period,
or to offer them some promotional product accessories for free.
Up selling
A customer calls requesting a new broadband connection. Customer Management identifies
that there is already a phone line in the house and it is close to the exchange so the TV
package could be offered. This prompts the CSR to ask the customer if they are interested in a
TV service alongside their broadband connection as the triple play bundle is only a few dollars
per month more than the separate phone and broadband monthly fees. If the customer says
yes, the CSR is prompted to offer the customer a discount on the connection fee if they agree
to use the service for a pre-defined period.
Operations in external systems
A prospect wishes to become a customer and purchase a product suite. On entering the
customer details, a request is automatically triggered to a credit agency system where a credit
check is made on the customer before the order is processed.
6.4 COMPUTER TELEPHONY INTEGRATION (CTI)
CTI is an important technology in contact centers. While once considered a productivity tool,
CTI is now a fundamental component of most contact centers with their focus on providing
value-added customer service. The major value of CTI to an organization is its ability to drive
down costs by increasing the productivity of CSRs. By automating certain tasks such as
bringing up customer details automatically, the CSR is able to spend more time on responding
to the customer inquiry.
Encompass’s CTI features are aimed at removing the CSR's reliance on manual data entry,
removing the CSR's reliance on telephony handset controls, ACD terminal unit, or a
corresponding soft-phone application. Customer Management supports all common call center
telephony operations from within the application by incorporating the available soft-phone
application functionality directly in Customer Management. For example, operations to answer
calls, hang up, and notify readiness from within Encompass are provided.

Figure 34: CTI Toolbar

Encompass does not provide direct integration with a switch, instead, a third party CTI product
(such as those available from Aspect, Genesys, Cisco, HP, and IBM) is required.  Customer
Management can be integrated with these products for inbound screen popping.
6.4.1 CUSTOMER IN FOCUS
For inbound calls the relevant customer can be brought into focus within the Customer
Management screen. Once the customer is identified using a combination of Calling Line
Identification (CLI) and/or Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technologies, the relevant
customer details can be automatically displayed to the CSR when the call is answered. The
search required for this function is configurable.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 72

If the call center uses ANI (Automatic Number Identification) or IVR that facilitates the
classification of a caller issue, Customer Management can automatically display the necessary
screen required to resolve the customer's query. The layout of the screen may be tailored by
the organization based on their requirements. The most common usage of this will be to
display a Case screen that is pre-populated with the caller details based on their service
number input.
6.5 EMAIL INTEGRATION
If a contact wants to communicate via email, one or more email addresses can be stored as
part of their personal information. The email address is used for outbound email sent to the
contact and as part of the handling of inbound email from the contact.
Customer Connect supports the following email handling:
• Initiate emails from within Customer Management
• Automatically receive new emails into Customer Management
• Automatically assign incoming emails to contacts and cases
• Automatically record incoming and outgoing email correspondence as ‘threads’ against
contacts and cases
• Easily view complete email conversation threads in Customer Management
• Store attachments with emails so that they can be viewed within Customer Management
• Assign anonymous emails into a separate bucket for handling
• Support HTML and text email format

6.6 WEB CHAT INTEGRATION
Encompass provides a comprehensive set of REST APIs to facilitate the integration of a 3
rd

party web chat solution, of which many exist in the market. This enables an organization to
use their preferred web chat system with a standardized integration to Encompass Customer
Management. In this scenario the web chat session will always be initiated outside of
Encompass.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 74

If a chat session is initiated with a customer identifier known to Encompass then the chat
session will automatically create a case against that customer in Customer Management, with
the reason code of “Chat”. If the chat session cannot be matched to a customer then the case
will still be created, but it will not be attached to a specific customer.

Many commercial web chat systems also provide integration with social media applications
such as Twitter and Facebook. The Encompass REST APIs can be used to support these
messages being populated against the relevant customer in Customer Management. Typically
the social media interaction is a discrete inbound message and so an Action can automatically
be created to ensure that the message is assigned to an agent to provide a response within a
certain time.

Figure 36: Action Created Due to Social Media Interaction
6.7 ANALYSIS TOOLS
Customer contact information is invaluable to organizations attempting to maintain a customer
focus. Information in Encompass can be classified using any number of data capture methods
that the business requires in order to be able to extract meaningful and useful data (for more
information refer to 6.9.4 Data Entry Control). This enables analysis of data to:
• Identify problem areas
• Target marketing campaigns
• Predict customer behavior
• Track sales trends
• Estimate market damage
• Improve service delivery
• Predict high and low contact center traffic to assist in staff rostering
• Produce other actionable management reports
Customer Management provides a complex search functionality to support this type of analysis
which is outlined below.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 75

6.7.1 COMPLEX SEARCHING
The complex search functionality is a valuable tool provided for team leaders or managers to
interrogate all the data in the Customer Management database. For example, the team leader
may wish to contact all customers who have a particular product and who live in a particular
area to let them know that there will be work going on in their area that may affect their
service.
This kind of inquiry would normally involve the user asking a technical expert to write a query
on the database, resulting in loss of time and an additional cost to the organization. The
Customer Management’s searching mechanism makes the task quick and simple, so that the
person requiring the information can make the query themselves, at their own convenience.
The complex search function allows the user to build a complex search by selecting fields,
operators, and values. The search may involve data from several different classes.  For
example, a CSR may need to retrieve all customers in the northwest region who have
purchased a service that uses voicemail.
A rich set of search operators is supported, including keyword and soundex searches.  If they
prefer, the user may also enter expression clauses, which define complex conditions using the
Encompass expression language. These expressions allow derived or aggregated values, such
as days in a time period, or the sum total of time spent solving a customer's problem, to be
included in a search.

Figure 37: Search Criteria

The user can also select fields that will be used to sort the search results.
Results of searches can be exported directly to Microsoft Excel or other application that
accepts CSV files at the click of a button for further manipulation and graphical analysis.
Searches can be saved and run as often as required by the user by selecting the saved search
from the menu.
6.8 USER INTERFACE
Customer Management’s Web interface is almost totally configurable and supports virtually
any required business process, encompassing screen layouts, business rules, and customer
contact types. Client operations consist of optimized views of critical data that provide access
to the information the user needs to perform their job.

6.8.1 IFRAME SUPPORT
Customer Management supports the embedding of iframes (inline frames) as an area of
screen real estate that can be defined to display content from a URL. Being able to link to
internal or external content from within Customer Management saves time for users by
avoiding the need to open additional applications for common tasks or information retrieval.
The URL can be derived from customer, account, or address information that is held within
Customer Management so that context sensitive links can be dynamically created. Some
examples: Google Maps, external Analytics solutions, Web chat applications.

Figure 39: Customer Management Home Page Layout

Global Bar
The global bar is displayed on all pages and the buttons and links are the same throughout the
system. When a user moves to another page a breadcrumb navigation path is displayed in the
bar. Buttons on the bar can be used for CTI system integration or retrieve an action.

Context Bar
The context bar displays the name of the current page with the fields and buttons displayed
being dependent on the task being undertaken and its status.
Gadgets
Gadgets list functions available to the user and enable them to quickly search for details or
create contacts. A user can customize their Home page by clicking on Customize Home, and
can specify what gadgets are displayed, can add their own or remove standard ones, and can
define where these are displayed on the page.
6.9.1 CASE MANAGEMENT
Customer Management utilizes a case management methodology to manage and track
customers and their associated information. The case view forms the basis for the CSR’s work,
displaying customer cases (or records of contact events) and their associated issues. The
contacts, customers, issues, orders, payments, campaigns, and actions associated with each
case are easily accessible in separate tabs on one screen, for shorter call times, more accurate
customer response and improved customer service. While the view is delivered preconfigured
‘out of the box’, its format, together with the corresponding tab layouts, is entirely definable
by the organization.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

6.9.2 SUPPORTED FUNCTIONS
The central attribute of an efficient contact management interface is the ability to perform as
many functions as possible within a single screen. In Customer Management, each view
supports searching, browsing, and editing.
Searching
Various mechanisms exist for searching for records matching given criteria.  Results returned
by a search are displayed in a list from which the CSR can determine next steps.
The list displays all matching records in a grid that can be manipulated by re-ordering rows
and refining the selection criteria.
For example, a search for a contact may be initiated from the Home screen at the start of a
call.

Figure 40: Contact Search
If there are multiple matches for the search criteria, a list will be presented to the CSR,
showing all matching records.

Figure 41: Search Result

The results list can be configured to enable validation of the contact details immediately. Once
validated, the CSR can initiate a task, such as a billing enquiry or address change, to continue
the call.
The results contained in the list section can be easily exported in Excel or CSV formats. This
enables the user to manipulate the data and produce graphical output without the need to
learn complicated reporting packages.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 79

Editing
It is not necessary to perform any special operation to begin editing a record displayed in a
view. Typing in a field will automatically initiate a transaction. The system maintains data
integrity through object locking, which prevents more than one user from editing a record or
associated records simultaneously. The system maintains a public copy of a record throughout
transactions, allowing users to continue to browse. This lock mode (known as 'semi-optimistic'
locking) allows excellent concurrence while maintaining data integrity.
6.9.3 DYNAMIC LAYOUT
Data collection and management requirements vary enormously depending on the nature of
the customer contact and the role of the user. Customer Management supports screen layouts
that change depending on context.
For example, a product inquiry screen might require demographic details to be collected in
order to suggest a product or service to the customer, whereas an account adjustment screen
may need to display extensive account information, including recent invoices. Similarly, the
role a user plays in the organization may influence the screen layout. Marketing may require
demographic information that is not useful to a contact center CSR.
This approach means that users are automatically presented with information relevant to their
current task, on a single screen, rather than requiring them to navigate to the appropriate
system function. Layouts can be easily updated through the use of the configuration tools.
In order to make best use of the available space on a screen, Customer Management has a
concept of an overlay group. This means that the same space on the screen can be used to
display different data depending on relevance to the current function.
For example, when displaying the details of the services and equipment purchased by a
customer, different data is displayed for a landline service than for a mobile service. Rather
than force the CSR to navigate through irrelevant information, the data fields for a landline
service and a mobile service can appear on the same position on the screen depending on
which one is required at the time.
Layouts may include various visual components for entering different types of data (for
example, drop-down lists, free text memo fields, check boxes). Each layout can include details
from multiple records.  For example, a customer layout can include lists of contact numbers or
addresses. Layouts resize dynamically, allowing a single layout to be used at different screen
resolutions.
Color can also be used to make the best possible visual impact for the CSR and to visually
differentiate the purpose of different information. For example, colors can be used in the
following areas:
• The background of any editable field on a layout
• The background of any read only field on a layout
6.9.4 DATA ENTRY CONTROL
Customer Management provides a number of features that control the data displayed and
entered by users.
Field state
Customer Management represents the state of a field visually. Mandatory or read-only fields
are highlighted. It is possible to control exactly when data may be entered, including changing
the state of a field as the case progresses. For example, when an issue has been resolved
some or all fields may automatically become read-only.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 80

Derived values
Fields can be derived, meaning that their value is calculated automatically by the system.
Customer Management supports this via expressions for defining the calculation.
Supported derivation types include those described in the following table.

DERIVATION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE
Initial Calculated when the record is created User creating a case is
defaulted as the case
owner
Default Calculated when all information required
for the calculation has been entered
Suggested product
defaults from
demographic details
Derived Always calculated Total amount of time
spent on a case
Lookup Retrieved from a referenced record Display the name of a
customer's organization
Indicator Displays the number of rows returned
from a search
Number of previous cases
raised by same customer
Alias Used to generate a unique identifier for
the record
Case number

Any calculations that might cause a delay in response can be processed asynchronously. The
system will immediately return all values it has available, leaving the asynchronously derived
values with their current values. Once values for these fields have been determined, they will
appear on the user's screen. This is a particularly useful feature for fields derived from
external systems.
Structured values
In addition to standard drop-down lists for selecting a value for a field, Customer Management
supports structured values. For structured values, the referenced data is defined in a
hierarchy. The system makes a series of cascading menus available to the user to work their
way through the hierarchy to the required value. All values are given an alias that can be
entered so that experienced CSRs will be able to type in the values directly after becoming
familiar with them.
This classification method is very useful in selecting from large and complex lists as it reduces
the margin for error and provides a guide for CSRs. It has the additional advantage of
improving analysis through the ability to report at each level of the hierarchy.
6.9.5 HIERARCHY BROWSER
As many Customer Management objects are inherently hierarchical, the system displays them
in an appropriate graphical format. Customer Management provides the ability to browse
hierarchical objects in a tree structure. The hierarchy browser provides a useable, efficient,
and attractive way of viewing and managing accounts, customers, products, and actions.

Figure 42: Customer Hierarchy
6.9.6 AUDIT
Customer Management supports the ability for full business level auditing. As opposed to
database level auditing, this capability provides meaningful information at the business level,
which helps to protect against fraudulent or malicious data access.
The audit log can record create, retrieve, update or delete activities on objects such as contact
and customer records. At the fact, or field level, it can record retrieval and update of values in
fields. Once audit records are no longer required, they can be archived or purged.
It is also possible to audit access to encrypted data which includes viewing of the data
irrespective of how the field is displayed.
Different levels of auditing can be set up for different user types, so if there are groups of
CSRs who deal with VIP customers, their level of auditing might be quite stringent compared
with CSRs who deal with the general public where auditing may not be necessary.
A separate view is provided within Customer Management that easily displays business audit
information, with the ability to view the ‘before’ and ‘after’ values. For example, a supervisor
could view all the invoice adjustments that a particular CSR had performed on a given day.
Other examples are seeing what changes were made to the customer's account on a particular
date or the activity on a customer's account over a one week period.

Easy reporting such as this, not only reduces the time spent on such tasks, but makes them
possible: many contact center supervisors simply do not have the tools to do this easily.

6.9.7 BROADCAST BANNER MESSAGES
A banner message area can be introduced to Customer Management screens for messages
that need to be broadcast to a group of CSRs, or to all CSRs.

These broadcast messages have the following characteristics:
• The message banner will be visible on all Customer Management screens
• Messages are displayed between specific start and end dates/times
• Messages can be cancelled prior to their scheduled end time
• Multiple messages will display in turn and can also be stepped through manually
• The banner is not visible when there are no messages relevant to the user logged in
• Configurable appearance (choice of top or bottom of screen, layout, fonts, etc.)
• Messages can be tenant and workgroup-specific
6.10 ENCOMPASS CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY
High levels of configuration have an impact on analysis and implementation time.  Customer
Management provides the best of both worlds – a pre-configured solution, with the flexibility
to customize. In order to provide reduced deployment time, reduced time-to-market, and an
efficient implementation, Customer Management is pre-configured with a best practice solution
to provide a head start to implementing your CRM business processes.
This chapter describes Customer Management functionality delivered out-of-the-box.
6.10.1 CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT
A campaign is an exercise initiated by an organization to elicit a specific type of response for a
defined group of customers or prospects.
In an outbound campaign, a set of contact events are scheduled and initiated by the
organization. In general, the contact is unsolicited.
In an inbound campaign, the target audience has been reached through a separate medium
(such as advertising). The customer or prospect initiates the contact events and the CSRs then
respond to the enquiries.
The objectives of a campaign vary widely. Examples include marketing, retention, information,
collection, and surveying. These can be outbound or inbound.  Campaigns may have multiple
objectives.
Campaign information for a customer is stored as a case. The information stored includes such
things as whether they have been the subject of a campaign and the outcome(s) of the
calls(s) for that customer. The total contact history of the customer is readily accessible to the
CSR for immediate reference. There are three main stages to a campaign, which are described
in the following sections.
6.10.1.1 CAMPAIGN DEFINITION
During this phase, the following items are defined:
• Objectives of the campaign
• Performance indicators
• Nature of the expected contacts
This phase is generally undertaken by the marketing and sales division in consultation with the
System Administrator who assists by defining the campaign in the system.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 84

6.10.1.2 CAMPAIGN ACTIVATION
Once a campaign has been defined it may be activated.  In the case of outbound campaigns,
this involves selecting the group of contacts to be targeted, and selecting the campaign. This
is achieved using the complex search mechanism to clearly identify the target contacts (for
more information, refer to section 6.7.1 Complex searching).
6.10.1.3 CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT
Customer Management supports the on-going management of an active campaign by
providing the CSR with the required screen layout for the campaign.
Where there is no predictive dialer in use, work groups can be used to deliver the next call to
a CSR (for more information on work groups, refer to section 6.2.2 Workgroups). CSG can
develop interfaces with predictive dialers as required.
For inbound campaigns, ANI, CLI or IVR allow Customer Management to pop the correct
screen for the campaign.
6.10.2 PROSPECT MANAGEMENT
Customer Management has been configured to allow for the creation of a contact with a status
of Prospect. In this instance, no billable customer account is created until the prospect is
signed up and wishes to order products and services.
All the information gathered about a prospect can be used by sales and marketing to follow up
on the opportunity to sell them a product that suits their requirements.
Once a prospect is created, it is a simple matter of changing the status and the user will be
presented with the option of then having customer and account records created. Once the
customer is created, an order can then be placed using the Order Entry functionality. This
order can be converted from the prospect’s previous order enquiry.
6.10.3 PRODUCT ENQUIRY
Customers, or potential customers, will contact an organization to enquire about the
company's products and services. Customer questions related to products and services may
include pricing and rate inquiries, and promotions. Users consequently require such product
and pricing information to address product and service enquiries and require the information
to be presented clearly and concisely. In addition, various types of customer information are
required for reporting and analysis purposes.

Figure 45: Product Enquiry
The features of the product enquiry provided in Customer Management include:

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 85

• Rate enquiries
• Promotions
• Logical workflow designed for the most common product/pricing scenarios
• Creation of automated follow-up activities assigned automatically to the individual or
workgroup responsible for the task
• Classification of the request
This structure is fully customizable to the business practices of the organization.
6.10.4 ORDER ENTRY AND MANAGEMENT
The order entry and order management business processes manage the way order requests of
customers are captured and processed. Within the sales order process there are two main
sub-processes:
• Order Entry – the capturing and verification of a customer’s request. It is important that
order entry is streamlined to allow customers to receive a quote or make their purchases
in an easy, timely manner
• Order Management – taking an entered order and completing it. This will ensure that
goods and services are quickly and accurately delivered to customers. It also encompasses
the management of order information, to allow orders to be searched, updated, and
cancelled
Encompass supports streamlined order entry processes and provides the ability to deliver an
integrated order entry, management and billing solution.
Order entry is one of the most important tasks carried out. Orders need to be entered
accurately, with reliable pass through to the billing system for correct charging and invoicing.
They also need to be entered as quickly as possible in order to increase call center efficiency
and customer satisfaction. In addition, the CSR needs guidance in recommending a product
that best meets the customer's needs.
Customer Management provides efficient, configurable order entry functionality that enables a
CSR to create and inquire on orders through a single screen.  This avoids the need for complex
and time-consuming navigation and reduces CSR training time.

Figure 46: Sales Order
6.10.4.1 PRODUCT SELECTION
The first stage of the selling process is product and offer selection. During this phase, the
product catalogue data is accessed to display available product offers that can be sold to the
customer.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 86

Product selection enables filtering of available products, providing the CSR with a list of
potential offerings for the customer. Product offers can be filtered by customer type, product
offer category, and product offer availability dates. If the user knows the stock keeping unit
number for the offer they can enter this in the SKU field.
To further assist the CSR, the system will provide notification if the product selected has
dependencies that cannot be met, or if a selected component requires another component in
order to be valid.
6.10.4.2 ORDER CREATION
Once a product offer has been selected, it can be ordered. The CSR is further assisted in this
part of the process by the indication of mandatory details to be collected. Therefore, the order
is virtually guaranteed to be 'right first time', ensuring efficient customer service, satisfied
customers, and cost savings in the order management process.
The mandatory product details will change according to the product selected and are
determined by the attribute definitions. This includes any service specific items, like assigning
a phone number, or equipment details, as well as adding feature details like email addresses
or friends and family numbers.
Multiple optional product components can be added to the order and multiple physical or
logical equipment items may be selected from an inventory register and reserved for a predefined period. This register can be filtered and may be held within Customer Management or
in an external system.
The CSR can take deposit payments via credit card, and this can be made mandatory before
completion of an order.
6.10.4.3 CREATING A QUOTE
Once the product has been selected and the features added then the user can decide whether
to proceed with submitting the order or to provide a quote by selecting the relevant option
from the “Order/Quote?” drop down list.
If Quote is selected then the user must enter the number of bill runs to quote for before
clicking on “Generate Quote”. Typically, the number of bill runs would be 2 in order to show
the initial charges, which could include pro-rated or one-off initiation charges, and then the
normal on going charges. The number of bill runs could be set to a higher number if the user
needed to model charges over a significant period of time.

Figure 47: Providing a Quote

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 87

After the quote has been generated and the charges displayed then the user can generate a
quote document for providing to the customer or can move on to submit the order. If the
customer does not wish to immediately place the order then the quote and quote document
can be retrieved at a later date in order to continue the process. The quote will remain valid
until it expires: the expiry date being driven either by the configured default quote validity
period or by the validity of the selected offer if that is sooner.

6.10.4.4 ORDER SUBMISSION
Orders may be saved without submitting them to Convergent Billing, enabling, for example, all
the order details to be collected so that a supervisor can review and approve the order prior to
order submission.
An order may be amended up to the time of submission, and an expiry time set. When this
time expires, a notification is sent to a workgroup or individual alerting them of the expiration.
Orders are submitted to Convergent Billing via the press of a button. The integral nature of
Convergent Billing and Customer Management provides assurance that orders are passed to
billing correctly every time, so there is no revenue lost due to errors in order capture and
synchronization.
6.10.4.5 ORDER MANAGEMENT
The order process supports the following:
• Book out of inventory items from the available inventory pool on confirmed orders
• Charging of activation or purchase charges on the customer’s first invoice
• Capability to integrate to warehousing or delivery systems for the delivery of tangible
inventory that was ordered by the customer
• Ability to trigger provisioning operations to a provisioning system at appropriate points in
the order management workflow
• Automatic activation of rating, billing and commerce engine at the completion of order
management workflow
• Manual post-activation workflow activities such as a welcome call or email, can be
automatically created at the completion of order management

6.10.4.6 FAST TRACKED ACTIVATIONS FOR MOBILE
To streamline order processing for mobile service providers, there is built in support for
prepaid and postpaid bundle activations. For prepaid, the activation process can be initiated
both for anonymous or registered customers. For postpaid the process is streamlined for
standard bundles, and if the customer wants additional features, the CSR is automatically
taken to the appropriate screen to facilitate that request.
6.10.5 PRODUCT MAINTENANCE
Customers will contact an organization wishing to upgrade or downgrade existing products and
service or to deactivate services or their entire account.
The types of product maintenance activities provided in the Customer Management preconfiguration include:
• Upgrade / downgrade a product to another compatible / available offer
• Add an optional inclusion (feature) to a product instance
• Add an optional service to a product instance
• Remove an optional component (service/feature) from an active product
• Modify the attributes of an active product instance
• Upgrade/downgrade/convert from Product A to Product B
• Transfer ownership of a product from Customer A to Customer B
• Cancel a product

ENCOMPASS 12

• Replace an equipment item (Mobile phone number (MSISDN) swap or replace SIM)
This structure is fully customizable to the business practices of the organization.
Depending on the call type, automatic actions will be assigned to ensure the appropriate
individual or workgroup actions any outstanding tasks.
6.10.6 ENTITLEMENTS / FREE UNITS MANAGEMENT
Entitlements or free units are blocks of free usage offered as incentives to encourage
subscription to a particular service or package, or to encourage additional usage. Entitlements
are linked to product offers and can be part of and controlled by the offer. This means that the
price for a periodic entitlement may be varied depending on the product offering that has been
sold to the customer.
Entitlements can apply to any type of service that incurs usage charges. Generally speaking,
entitlements can be:
• Bundled as part of a package or offered separately
• Recurring or one off with a validity period controlling their expiry
• Associated with a particular service or shared between multiple services on the same
customer node, across a customer hierarchy or with any other customer in the system
• Applied to events based on customizable criteria, such as event types, for example, local
mobile to mobile, and/or rate bands, for example, peak/off-peak/weekend
Some common examples of entitlements include:
• Network time – free minutes for voice calls or Internet access e.g. 1hour of Facebook
• Event count – free number of events for particular types, e.g. SMS messages, music
tracks, games, video clips, etc.
• Data volume – free Gbytes of data uploaded/downloaded
• Total spend – free monetary amount regardless of event type
The ability to manage those entitlements is an important part of customer support, including:
• Answering customer enquiries about allocated entitlements
• Updating existing entitlements
• Granting additional entitlements in an ad hoc manner
The ability to update entitlements and grant additional entitlements is controlled by security to
ensure appropriate access.
6.10.7 BILLING ENQUIRY
The provision of detailed billing information to users is vital. It is essential that this information
be presented logically in one screen, which ensures timely, consistent, and efficient customer
service, usability, and reference.
Customer Management's Billing Enquiry issue provides an effective method of displaying all
billing enquiry details on one screen. Users are assisted in making adjustments and resolving
disputes by having quick and easy access to all previous transaction details on the account.
The Billing Enquiry issue provides the user with a complete picture of the history and current
financial status of a customer account and enables them to answer questions about the
customer account by viewing:
• Primary and deposit account numbers
• Current balance of each account number
• Balance date of each account number
• Number of months the account balance of each account number has been outstanding
• A list of transactions for each account (for example, adjustments, payments, invoices,
statements, rejected payments, disputes and initial balance)
• Details of each transaction

• A list of events for each invoice
• A list of unbilled events

The user is also able to view an image of an invoice or statement and print these if required.

Figure 48: Billing Enquiry
6.10.8 ACCOUNT ADJUSTMENT
Adjusting accounts easily and in minimal time is essential to reduce churn, maintain customer
loyalty, and meet service level agreements.
The Account Adjustment issue provides the ability to perform an adjustment in one screen.
This leads directly to an increase in call quality, a decrease in call duration, and a single call
resolution, which contributes to customer loyalty and reduction in churn.
Each user has an adjustment limit per transaction and, if the entered adjustment is above the
user’s limit, the transaction is passed to a supervisor to approve using the workflow
capabilities.
Adjustments can be made in any currency configured for the particular adjustment type.
6.10.9 INVOICE DETAILS ADJUSTMENT
Billing and account related calls are received on a daily basis, and there are a number of
reasons that may drive requirements to make adjustments to invoice details, such as
misapplied amounts.
The Invoice Details Adjustment issue provides an efficient method of creating adjustments to
invoice details (events) from one screen. Customer Management has the capability of
adjusting several events in a single adjustment transaction.
The user’s adjustment limit is checked against each event that is adjusted and, as for the
Account/Invoice Adjustment, the transaction is passed to a supervisor for approval if
necessary.

6.10.10 PAYMENT
The payment functionality allows a CSR to record a single payment for a customer, update an
existing payment, or search for payments that may not have been able to be allocated to the
correct account. Functionality is also provided to quickly transfer an ‘unidentified’ payment to
the correct account. Payments are immediately registered in Convergent Billing, updating the
customer’s balance. Payments can be made in any currency configured for the particular
payment type.
Appropriate interfaces to external systems such as a payment gateway are required for
payment processing.
6.10.10.1 MOBILE PREPAID VOUCHER DISCHARGE
Voucher top-ups remain a feature for some mobile prepaid products. When interfacing to an
Intelligent Network (IN), the CSR can discharge prepaid vouchers from their desktop. The built
in functionality provides the functionality ready for integration to the IN so that the CSR can
perform prepaid top ups easily and quickly.
6.10.11 TREATMENT AND COLLECTIONS
When a customer fails to pay an invoice within the expected timeframe they typically enter a
formal treatment process, otherwise known as dunning or collections. Customer Management
can proactively manage the tracking and processing of overdue accounts recovering
outstanding monies in an efficient and consistent manner.
6.10.11.1 BENEFITS OF ENCOMPASS’S CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT TREATMENT PROCESS
• Can easily identify customers ‘in treatment’ and manage risk
• More accurately forecast cash flow by recording overdue amounts and anticipated recovery
timeframes. Customer Management provides the ability to apply security deposits against
outstanding monies owed and to charge treatment fees to cover the cost of executing the
treatment workflow
• Recovery steps can be tailored to maximize customer retention. Credit management
policies can be applied per customer type and selected customers can be exempted from
entering treatment
• ‘Promise to Pay’ functionality suspends treatment and gives customers the opportunity to
work to a payment plan to avoid disconnection

An arbitration mechanism is provided for customer-disputed amounts that enable line items to
be disputed without penalizing the customer for making valid enquiries.
6.10.11.2 THE TREATMENT PROCESS
Once a customer’s payment is overdue, a structured set of actions is triggered to prompt the
customer to submit a payment and the treatment process continues until payment is received.
Scheduled functions are used to monitor each customer.
A treatment issue is created in Customer Management and provides an effective means of
allowing CSRs to monitor progress and prompt them to perform any manual steps required.
If a customer pays sufficient outstanding monies and the treatment monitor deems that the
customer should no longer be in treatment, the outstanding case, issue and action is
automatically closed by the system.
Underlying treatment functionality is managed within Convergent Billing where processes and
rules are defined; see section 4.18 for more details. This may include who enters treatment
and when and the next treatment steps. CSR activity is managed within Customer
Management whereby a treatment case, issue, and any follow-up are monitored.
Manual CSR follow-up is also managed in Customer Management through user-friendly
screens that handle customer treatment information.

6.10.12 PROMISE TO PAY
When billing and account related calls result in a customer not being able to pay outstanding
invoices within the expected timeframe, there must be efficient and consistent methods of
allowing the customer an extension of the payment terms without impacting on the customer
entering the treatment process.
The Promise to Pay issue provides an effective method of recording agreement payment
arrangements for a customer in one screen, resulting in the creation of a query in the
Convergent Billing.
6.10.13 INVOICE DISPUTE
When billing and account related calls result in a dispute, there must be an efficient and
consistent method of recording and resolving disputes.
The Invoice Dispute issue provides an effective method of recording disputed invoices and
events in one screen, resulting in the creation of a dispute in Convergent Billing. This ensures
that all information regarding the dispute is captured and the dispute is resolved in a timely
manner enabling service level agreements to be met, churn reduced, and customer loyalty
maintained.
6.10.14 TROUBLE SHOOTING
Any problems reported by customers must be tracked.  For reporting and analysis purposes,
product development, meeting service level agreements, and general customer service, an
efficient and effective business process for recording problem issues is required.
Users require the ability to work through complex problems the customer may be having with
a product or service. The user may need to assign work to different groups or to fix a problem
while the customer is on the line. As trouble reporting from customers may result in
adjustments to customer accounts, the ability to access an adjustment mechanism with ease
and speed is also required.
The troubleshooting issue provided with the Customer Management pre-configuration
includes:
• Classification of the type of problem the customer is having
• Problem detail
• Product involved
Specific call scenarios also have automatic actions assigned to them to record that a call of
this kind has been handled and if required, either automatically or manually assigned to the
appropriate individual or workgroup for completion.
Triggers can be used to display relevant information to assist users to determine the root
cause of the problem and resolve it.
On occasion, troubleshooting issues result in the need for an adjustment on a customer's
account. Access to the required adjustment is located on the issue toolbar.
6.10.15 INCIDENTS
An incident is a problem that could affect many customers, with the first indication being
numerous customers raising troubleshooting issues with the same cause. An authorized user
can create an incident which can then be linked to existing and new troubleshooting issues.
This allows the issues raised to be managed as a group.
When the incident is resolved, the system will attempt to close all troubleshooting issues
linked to the incident and then notify the customers who have requested a notification.

6.10.16 CUSTOMER SERVICE
Organizations require an efficient means of collecting general information that may impact
their business, and record feedback from customers. Having the ability to foresee revenue
impact, create marketing strategies, and improve the company image is essential. The
information collected provides an accurate insight into the marketplace, allowing an
organization to focus their efforts on customer service and future development.
The customer service issue provided with the Customer Management pre-configuration
includes:
• Classification of the type of customer service call
• Detail of the problem
Specific call scenarios also have automatic actions assigned to them to record that a call of
this kind has been handled and, where appropriate, to ensure the appropriate individual or
workgroup follows through with any outstanding tasks.
6.10.17 CONFIGURATION WORKBENCH
Customer Management is a highly configurable product designed to meet the dynamic needs
and changing nature of the organizations that use it. Configuration Workbench (if supplied) is
used to tailor many aspects of the solution without code changes.
• For CSG, this facilitates our partner strategy by separating configuration from core
software, allowing a third party to independently tailor the application for their target
marketplace
• For your organization, it can reduce or remove the reliance on CSG to supply all
configuration services, increasing the ability to make rapid changes to business practices
as necessary
The tools included in the Configuration Workbench are available from drop-down menus, or by
clicking on the relevant icon on the toolbar. The tools are described in this section, grouped by
menu.

This tool allows definition of escalation policies with appropriate action types. Escalation
policies assist an organization to ensure that actions are completed by their due date.
Notification Tool
This tool allows definition of messages to be sent to users or contacts to notify them that an
action event has occurred. Subject and body text, and method notification (email or pop-up
message) can be defined.
Status Tool
The status of an object determines the fields that may be edited for that object. For example,
once a case is resolved, it may not be desirable to allow users to continue to change its

A highly configurable system such as Customer Management entails significant
interdependencies between various configuration items. To provide a detailed and easily
comprehensible view of these relationships, the Configuration Workbench supports a
Dependency Browser, a visual representation of the interrelationships involved. This view
graphically displays various types of dependencies between objects within a configuration. The
System Administrator can navigate through the dependency links, altering configuration data
as required.

6.10.17.8 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
The Customer Management architecture allows separate environments to be maintained for
configuration, testing, training and production. A save/load utility is used to transfer
configurations between these environments.  This supports the requirements of multi-phased
environmental and testing approaches.
6.10.17.9 ARCHIVING
Both configuration items and data can be archived. The System Administrator determines
which items to archive by defining a search and chooses whether to delete or store the
selected items. Integrity is checked through the archiving mechanism, which can be scheduled
or run on demand. A very fine level of granularity is supported, giving the System
Administrator a great deal of flexibility in what is archived.
For configuration data, this selection can be as precise as a single class definition, fact
definition, layout group, or trigger operation. Non-configuration data can include all facts for a
single object; for example, all those for an individual contact.

7. ENCOMPASS CUSTOMER CONNECT FUNCTIONALITY
A comprehensive Product Description for Customer Connect is available. This section is based
on a summary of this material and should be used as a summary and introduction to
Customer Connect only.
7.1 PRODUCT OVERVIEW
Your Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) are one of your main contact points with your
customers. By providing effective tooling to these communities, you can strengthen the
relationships you can build with your customers.

Figure 50: Customer Connect, and Key CSP Positive Outcomes
Customer Connect is the Out of the Box (OOTB) CRM user interface that complements
Singleview 11 and Encompass 12 deployments. It provides customer acquisition, order
handling, billing care and point of sale features that are pre-integrated with Singleview 11 and
Encompass 12 instances and share important items of configuration and operational
information.
Customer Connect has been optimized by CSG Experiences Practice. It draws on many years
of practical CRM system deployments to provide an OOTB solution with embedded “best
practice” to help your CSRs:
• Interact more efficiently with customers and proactively resolve customer issues, to
achieve a higher level of customer satisfaction
• Up-sell more effectively, to increase revenue contribution from the call-center
• Reduce call-handling times, to reduce operational expenses.
Its ergonomic design also improves CSR’s working environment, so reducing staff churn and
attrition and training costs for your call center.

Customer Connect helps your CSRs manage your relationship with customers through the
entire customer life cycle.

Figure 51: Customer Connect and the Customer's Life Cycle
Customer Connect provides four main functional components:
• Base (Mandatory) - Common capabilities usable across all functional modules. For
example, case, issue type, action, comment frameworks commonly used across
ordering and billing care.
• Billing Care (Mandatory) – Serve a customer’s billing query including any actions
relating to bill and invoice payment, balances, loyalty and voucher, entitlements,
disputes and adjustments. Also includes collections, treatments and terminations.
Cases specifically defined for these purposes are provided by this function. Searching
and viewing contacts, customers, their products and product configuration is provided
in Billing Care
• Customer Information Management (Optional) - Gather customer information
necessary to establish and maintain the customer 360° view; contact details,
hierarchies, preferences and historic information such as cases, orders, purchased
products and contact points and whether they have been barred. Provide integration
to 3rd party systems such as identity management systems. Also provides
troubleshooting and service request handling in response to customer’s enquiries.
Not required if external CRM is the contact and customer master information
• Order Entry and Management (Optional) – Manage a customer’s order through
negotiations and CPQ configuration and pricing stages, initiating ordering, performing
order handling tasks through to completion and tracking order and ordered product
history. Covers initial provisioning, updates to services through child-offers,
relocations and terminations. The final step is the initiation of billing.
Not required if customer has a strategic order handling system
Customer Connect screens have been designed around CSR’s workflow. They assist CSRs in
navigating through dialogue with the customer, and present relevant information at each
point.

Figure 52: Customer Connect Provides CSRs with Full Customer Visibility
Customer Connect also provides global search bars, a CSR toolbox, and primary and
secondary navigation-panes to ensure that CSRs is just a few clicks away from the information
they need and is directed towards the key tasks they should be working on.
CSRs screens can be augmented to include integrated screens from other applications,
involved with relevant context, or have customized panels implemented for the specific
project.
Many CRM deployments achieve compliance to highly specialized requirements through
customization. Once customized, they become very difficult, expensive and time-consuming to
upgrade, meaning that opportunities to leverage new product capabilities are lost. Customer
Connect follows a different approach by ensuring that it is an upgradable component of your
infrastructure:
• Customer Connect application is designed as a product to be released and upgraded
through versions with add new capabilities introduced through a published product
roadmap
• Customer Connect provides “best practice” capabilities which can be configured to
meet general requirements, and also provides specific points for plug-in of customized
or 3
rd
 party screens
• By adhering to the boundaries of configuration and customization, you will continue to
enjoy upgradability to leverage new capabilities Customer Connect makes available to
you.
Finally, Customer Connect is fully pre-integrated into Singleview 11 and Encompass 12
solutions. This reduces the risk, timeline, and cost for the introduction of your CRM front-end.

7.2.2.1 CUSTOMER REGISTRATION
Customer Connect is used to create Contacts and Customers and create the Hierarchies that
describe their relationships.
As part of the action, CSRs is guided through selecting the type of customer and entering
specific Contact information such as address, contact numbers, validated email addresses etc.
CSRs is also guided through the association of Customers to Contacts and Customers to Child
Customers in the hierarchy.
As part of the account settings for a Contact, various preferences can be defined.
Customer Connect also allows product enquiries by Prospects (i.e., not an existing customer or
contact). In this case, CSRs can review product offerings and get quotes created for specific
configurations on behalf of the Contact, and then create a Contact and customer once
approval is provided to continue. In this case, eligibility checks are performed once the
Contact and customer information is provided.
The Customer can also be authenticated by Customer Connect by offering multiple
configurable options including fingerprint, customer specific questions and OTP.
Customers and Contacts can also have their status changed with the Reason for Change being
documented.

Customer Connect presents both the post-paid account elements (i.e., balances, statements,
invoices, and payments) and pre-paid account elements (i.e., balances and top-ups). These
are defined through the underlying MMS configurations. Customer Connect does not support a
single product that combines both post-paid and pre-paid elements.
7.2.3.8 CUSTOMER RECEIVES NOTIFICATIONS
Customer Connect allows CSRs to communicate with the customer through emails as well as
through verbal conversations. All written notifications sent to the customer by CSRs are
tracked with the Case, and the Case also tracks phone-based conversations with any
comments added by CSRs.
Customer Connect can initiate notifications based on transitions of a Case life cycle.
If any notifications or interactions have taken place through SMS, and initiated by the
Encompass back-end, these are also shown in the history of interactions with the customer.
Please note that Customer Connect does not include the ability to initiate SMS distributions to
a customer.
Also, associated with notifications is the retention of communications preferences from a
perspective of personal information protection and privacy – Customer Connect allows CSRs to
record the customer’s communications preferences.
7.2.4 CHANGE
7.2.4.1 CUSTOMER UPGRADES OR DOWNGRADES PLAN
Customer Connect allows upgrades or downgrades to be performed in accordance with the
product catalogue held in Encompass.

devices. Discounts, top-ups, and deposits are also handled in this way.
A history of changes to a product is also provided.
Customer Connect allows configurable logic to control what Account Actions can be performed
for a specific account based on its status.
Orders can also be cancelled subject to them being at a status for which a cancel is a valid
action.
Customer Connect allows CSRs to convert a subscriber’s service from post-paid to pre-paid
and vice versa from this drop-down.
As a special case of downgrade, a customer can terminate a service via CSRs. CSR can also
set a scheduled time for termination of a service. Validity dates (for pre-paid) and end-billcycle date (for post-paid) are handled.
7.2.4.2 CHANGE CUSTOMER HIERARCHY

Customer Connect allows CSRs to record and then apply saved payment methods.
7.2.4.5 CUSTOMER CHANGES CONNECTED SERVICE ADDRESS AND SERVICE ATTRIBUTES
Customer Connect allows CSRs to change the service address associated with a delivered
product. This triggers a service addressability activity, scheduling for installation (if required)
and prompts CSRs to change the plan or cancel the service if it cannot be delivered to the new
address.
Service attributes can be set upon order entry and updated subsequently from the product
instance screens. The list of service attributes is drawn from a set of tables which are, in turn,
associated with specific service types, through configuration.
7.2.4.6 CUSTOMER CHANGES SIM CARD
Customer Connect allows CSRs to change SIM when the SIM is lost, damaged, stolen or is
changed when a new device is purchased. Customer Connect allows CSRs to request a SIM
swap with delivery. Additional charges may be made to the customer, depending on the
Product Catalogue definitions in Encompass.

• Billing information and transactions
• Products and services purchased
• Last orders

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 107

• Open cases
• History of interactions.
This provides context so CSRs can interact appropriately with the customer.
7.2.5.2 CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOOLBOX
Customer Connect provides a CSR toolbox. This is designed to help guide CSRs to the right
activities for them to handle.
Other features of Customer Connect designed to guide CSRs are:
• Global search tool allowing searches for Customer, Contact, Cases and Orders. The
columns displayed in the Global Search outcomes and their order can be configured
• Cases tracking each interaction with a customer, providing detail of associated Issues
and Activities, a history of steps and record of communications
• Banners and alerts to make CSRs aware of issues that will influence how they
approach customers.
7.2.5.3 QUERY TO ANSWER
Customer Connect screens are designed to present appropriate information to CSRs to search
for common customer queries. The global search is used to identify the contact or customer
and open their overview, from here CSRs can quickly open information about Cases, Products,
Orders or Billing. The global search also allows CSRs to start with the Case or Order.
Any interaction with the customer is recorded in a Case which records all stages, issues,
activities, and communication associated with that Case.
Actions (part of Cases and Issues) have a specific duration associated with them – if the
duration expires, the visual representation of the Action on CSR’s screen changes to show that
this Action is overdue.
The Customer Summary screen is designed to provide a full set of information about the
customer and their services to support in the handling of a query.
7.2.5.4 PROBLEM TO RESOLUTION
Customer Connect allows CSRs to associate a Troubleshooting Issue to be associated with a
Case. When raised, CSRs can lodge a range of types of problem, record details from the
customer about the nature of the problem and record how the customer wishes to be
notified/updated as the problem is progressed. Customer Connect allows a CSR to create and
manage Incidents so that an Incident can be created from or associated with a customer
reported problem.
Customer Connect allows Trouble-shooting and custom Issue Types to be customized by a
specific deployment such that information associated with the Issue can be made visible or
invisible to CSRs through customization. Customer Connect allows the upload of (multiple)
documents for Trouble-shooting and Custom issues.
Customer Connect allows CSRs to associate a Customer Service request with a Case. The type
of Customer Service request can be selected from options.
Other types of Issue relevant to financial problem resolution associated with a Case are:
• Billing Enquiry
• Dispute
• Account Adjustment.
Customer Connect guides CSRs through handling these Cases.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 108

All Cases are managed through to completion with each step recorded. Cases may involve
multiple Issues, which may have multiple Activities associated with them and customer
communications associated with them.
At a higher level, Customer Connect presents a view of the history of interaction, including
Cases, with a specific customer. This allows CSRs to gauge whether this specific Case and
interaction is related to a wider problem, and also set the “tone” for the conversation based on
the number and type of Cases raised.
Finally, Customer Connect Collections/Treatment functions can be applied to help a customer
manage their finances by restructuring payment terms and accommodating “promise to pay”
actions. Collections/Treatments also include service suspension and resumption features.
7.2.6 PAY (OR NOT) CUSTOMER JOURNEYS

information including:
• Billing summary
• Payments, payment history, including a configurable set of attributes for the payments
made
• Invoices
• Transactions
• Disputes
• Settings and preferences
• Collections, history and age of debt and any current collections in effect.
As well as viewing information, CSRs can initiate several actions including:
• Making a payment
• Creation and adjustment or dispute
• Transferring a balance
• Making one-off payments
• Using vouchers, including using vouchers presented by an anonymous person for
another account
• Generating an immediate bill

Please note, for Loyalty Payment, and integration to a loyalty system is required. A conversion
table for loyalty and currency can be set up.
Customer Connect allows CSRs to initiate payment activities using these pre-defined payment
methods or introducing a new payment method. Cash is included in the payment method.
Customer Connect allows a customer to create several saved payment methods – note, CSRs
is not able to take a credit card number – a tokenized reference is used and visible to CSRs.
7.2.6.3 PAYMENT METHODS AND CHANNELS
Customer Connect allows a customer to make a payment using more than one payment
method (for example, cash and credit card, or credit card with loyalty points, prepaid account
balance, pre-paid account balance).
7.2.6.4 IMMEDIATE INVOICE
Customer Connect allows CSRs to generate an immediate bill which is then presented in the
lists of invoices sent to the customer.
An immediate invoice can be generated upon customer request. Also, immediate invoices are
automatically generated for upfront charges upon subscription or for device payments.
Customer Connect allows CSRs to define the email address to which the invoice is to be sent.
The customer can then pay the invoice and receive a receipt.
7.2.6.5 PRE-PAY RECHARGE
Customer Connect allows CSRs to view Recharge payments for a pre-pay service. As well as a
summary showing the Prepaid Balance and a graphical view of recharge payments, CSRs can
see a complete history of recharge payments and view the details of each.
When making a payment, the customer receives a receipt.
7.2.6.6 PRE-PAY ONE-OFF/RECURRING FEES
Customer Connect uses the product catalogue in Encompass to present one-off and recurring
fees for products. Payments for up-front one-off payments can be taken as part of the order
handling process managed by Customer Connect.
Recurring fees would be presented by Customer Connect on the invoices tab of the billing
screen. From this screen, CSRs can initiate payment.
When making a payment, the customer receives a receipt.
7.2.6.7 POST-PAY PERIODIC INVOICE
Customer Connect presents CSRs with all the invoices associated with a Customer. CSRs can
process partial or complete payment of the invoice by referring to the payment methods
described above. When making a payment, the customer receives a receipt.
7.2.6.8 REFUND
Customer Connect allows adjustments to be made to bills. An adjustment is recorded through
a Case with all the Case tracking and presentation covered above. With an adjustment, CSRs
can define the Adjustment Type (including credit adjustment, credit note, debit note, misc.
credit) and the reason for adjustment (including denies knowledge of call, disconnect during
call, finance charge, goodwill, NSF surcharge, poor call reception, rebill to account, transfer
account balance and write-off).
A customer will have a maximum adjustment limit set with configurable periods: Rolling Day,
Rolling Week, Rolling Month, Rolling Year, Calendar Day, Calendar Month, and Calendar Year.
A CSR has a pre-defined adjustment limit. If the adjustment is beyond that pre-defined limit,
Customer Connect automatically initiates a task with a supervisor to review the request.
Tax adjustments are also handled through this method.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 110

As well as recording the adjustment within the Case, Customer Connect also presents the
adjustment in the billing information. Many aspects of the adjustment issue screen can be
configured to be project specific.
If the refund relates to a Dispute, CSRs can also create a Case for a Dispute.
7.2.6.9 CHARGEBACKS AND INDEMNITIES
Customer Connect allows CSRs to manage a chargeback or indemnity activity through the
Dispute and Adjustment process described above.
7.2.6.10 NON-PAYMENT – RECOVERY OF OVERDUE DEBT
Customer Connect allows CSRs to manage collections. CSRs can set up payment
arrangements and strategies for collection associated with the account which is overdue.
Payment arrangements and the collections process can be quickly suspended. Collection
details and history are shown. The service can be suspended or resumed as part of the
collections process.
7.2.6.11 SEARCHING FOR UNIDENTIFIED PAYMENTS
Customer Connect allows CSRs to search through unidentified payments in case funds have
been received, but not assigned to a specific account. CSRs can then assign the payment to
the correct account. This would likely be the result of a customer receiving a treatment notice.
7.2.7 LEAVE CUSTOMER JOURNEYS
7.2.7.1 END-CUSTOMER INITIATED
7.2.7.1.1 CUSTOMER RETENTION ATTEMPTS
Customer Connect exposes several functions and features specifically for handling loyalty of
customers with a view to retaining their custom:
• Tailored Recommendations for Selling – Customer Connect allows CSRs to present
product recommendations which are based on the Encompass product catalogue
• Retention Offers for Recovering a Customer about to Leave – If a customer has
declared an intention to leave, Customer Connect can present a group of Retention
product offers to the customer
• Collections – Collections are an opportunity to develop customer loyalty by presenting
a modified payment plan which aligns to the customer’s ability to pay. CSRs have the
flexibility to define and redefine payment plans and suspend the collection process to
restore blocked services if the customer has a good reason for non-payment
• Extension of Validity and Payment Dates – CSRs can extend validity of pre-paid
balances and can change the payment date for invoices
• Discounts and Negotiations – CSRs have the option of applying discounts within a
negotiation process as part of the product purchasing activities
• Adjustments – Customer Connect allows CSRs to process adjustments on behalf of the
customer. Agreeing to an adjustment is an opportunity for CSPs to build loyalty with
their customers.
If a customer does decide to leave, then Customer Connect assists CSRs by guiding them
through the following key activities:
• Reason for leaving
• Cancelling products and processing termination orders with a reason code documented
• Termination fees/refunds, loss of entitlements, loss of loyalty points
• Returns of equipment (or CPE collection by engineer)

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 111

• Return and quarantine of logical inventory (e.g., numbers)
• Notifications and customer communication
• Closing bill
• Collections, if the customer fails to pay the final bill
• Data archiving (GDPR etc.).
7.2.7.2 CSP INITIATED
In the case where the CSP initiates the activity, this may also be managed through a callcenter function using Customer Connect, through it is also likely that a back-end function
performs operations directly in Encompass.
The Customer Connect features applied are much the same as for the above case where the
termination is customer initiated:
• Barring – as a precursor to termination, a contact may be barred in which case, this
status is clearly shown, and the actions performed by CSRs for the contact become
restricted
• Reason for termination – delinquent account, behavior, inactivity, Government request
• Cancelling products with reason codes
• Termination fees/refunds, loss of entitlements, loss of loyalty points
• Returns of equipment (or CPE collection by engineer)
• Return and quarantine of logical inventory (e.g. numbers)
• Notifications and customer communication
• Closing bill
• Collections, if the customer fails to pay the final bill
• Data archiving (GDPR etc.).
8. ENCOMPASS SECURITY
Each Encompass user is assigned a security profile, which provides the security privileges
needed to perform specific tasks.
The information recorded for each user includes:
• A user name and password, used for logging on to Encompass
• Access rights to the database, allowing the user to connect to the database and,
optionally, giving them the right to grant other users access similar to their own
• The security profile that defines their access privileges to Encompass data, menu items,
and forms
• Personal information, such as the full name of the user, an email address, and contact
telephone numbers
Security allows the specification of the access levels for each system user.
The security structure provided for users using a client workstation is based on these
elements:
• Each user needs to be defined, with a user name and a password
• A user is given a security profile designed to provide access to the data and the
Encompass forms required to carry out the user’s function

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 112

A security profile is made up of these elements:
• One or more security roles, which define the menu items and forms that are available to
the user and the operations they can perform. For example viewing or inserting records or
control over form specific items such as restricting insertion of future dated payments on
the payments form
• One or more security groups, which define the database entities that the user can access.
For example, updating, inserting or deleting records
• One or more function roles which define the remote functions that the user can access
• One or more work groups which are used for the management of customer queries

Access levels can be set within roles and groups to manage the data access privileges
required by users assigned the profile. The allocated access level determines the level at which
the user can work with the forms, data, or queries; for example, access level options can be
selected to allow a user to:
• View records
• View decrypted, masked or unmasked data
• Update records
• Insert records
• Delete records
• View, insert or update queries for a work group

The diagram below sets out the relationships between security elements.

Figure 58: Security Model

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 113

8.1 FORM ROLES
Form roles provide users with access to particular forms and menu items, and control the
updating privileges available when working with each form. There are many different
form/menu items to choose from and therefore assigning them to roles permits convenient
groupings of related functions and provides more simplified management of security.
A profile that has multiple roles containing the same form/menu items and different access
levels in each role provides the broadest access available by combining the individual levels.
For example, if one role contains a form with an access level of 'view' only and a different role
also contains the same form, but with an access level of 'update', a user with a profile
containing both roles would be able to view and update data using that form.
A role can deny a user access to a particular form. The creator of the role can select an option
to choose whether the menu item associated with that form is completely invisible or disabled.
A grayed-out area indicates the usage inability.
To define a role, there is a need to determine:
• Tasks that are performed by the users assigned this role
• Menu items and forms required for these tasks
• Update privileges required for the data on each form
In role planning, it is advisable to simplify the organization’s roles so that allocation and
maintenance are manageable tasks. For example, if users within a team require access to the
same menu items and forms, only one role needs definition for the team's profile. If some
team members also require access to other forms (for example, forms for data maintenance)
their profile can include the role for the whole team and another for the maintenance forms.
Roles provide access to menu items and forms, but do not control access to the actual data
stored in Encompass which is handled using security groups.
8.2 SECURITY GROUPS
Security groups are used to control access to the data within the Encompass database and are
used to categorize data to allow for easier control over its access. Data belonging to a specific
group can only be seen by users who belong to the same group. The ability to modify or delete
this data is further controlled by access privilege settings.
A security group can be defined as either an Individual Security Group or a Security Group
Set, where a set consists of two or more individual security groups amalgamated together.
This model provides flexibility in defining hierarchies of users that might be associated with
complex organizations or resellers and partners.
Security groups work as follows:
• Each user belongs to a primary group, defined in the user profile
• A user can belong to more than one group, though only one can be the primary group
• If data is covered by security groups, it is attached to the user's primary group when it is
created
• Data attached to a security group can be seen only by users who belong to the same
group, provided that the role defined in their profile allows access to the appropriate menu
items and forms
• The access privileges for a user belonging to the correct group are determined by the
access levels set in the security profile
• Users with sufficient access privileges can change the group to which data is attached

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 114

8.3 WORK GROUPS
A user or group of users responsible for progressing and resolving queries for follow-up is
called a work group. A work group is similar to a security group in that queries are attached to
a work group in the same way as data is attached to a security group. To work with a query,
the user profile must contain the work group that has been assigned to the query.
Work groups can often be based on workflow and are used with Customer Connect and
Customer Management.  When planning work groups, a workflow map is often used. This map
provides the information required for determining the work groups that need to be defined and
to whom they need to be assigned.
8.4 FUNCTION ROLES
Function roles define the set of remote Transaction Engine (TRE) Functions that a user is
allowed to call.
8.5 CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT SECURITY
There are additional Customer Connect and Customer Management entities described below
that the security model extends to. If a user is granted access to both Convergent Billing and
Customer Connect and/or Customer Management they will have a single login.
Security at the user level determines if the user can access the system. If a user is granted
access to Customer Connect, their view security is checked. If the user can access the view,
object security determines objects in the view that the user can access. If the user can access
an object, fact security determines the object data the user can access

ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION
User
A user is any person who is able to log onto any of the
Customer Connect and Customer Management applications.
Each user is assigned a role (or multiple roles) that provides the
necessary privileges to perform specific tasks and access
specific data.
Class
A class describes a set or category of objects. Therefore, an
object is an instance of a class. Each object has the same
attributes but may have different values.
Each contact has the same number of attributes because each
contact is a member of the same class (that is, the Contact
class). However, each contact can have different values for each
attribute or no value at all.
Security can be applied to all objects in the class or different
groups of objects in the class as identified by one or a
combination of attributes such as Type, for example different
customer types.
Object
An object is an entity in the system. It represents a single
unique item, such as a contact's details. Attributes (one or
more) define an object.
It is possible to limit access to a specific object's information by
assigning a different security group to it. For example security
can be applied to a specific action of type 'Follow up Call' with a
duration greater than 3 days and assigned to a specific user.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 115

ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION
Fact A fact represents an attribute of an object such as the family
name of the contact.
Toolbar and Menu
Operation
Security groups assigned to menu and toolbar operations
ensure that the option or button is either available to the user
or hidden. If a user is assigned a profile containing the same
security group as the menu or toolbar operation, they can view
the operation wherever it is configured.
View
A view displays information about various objects either from
the same class or associated classes. For example, the Contact
view displays information about the contact and from other
relevant classes such as Cust_Acct, Case, Issue, and Action.
If the user has permission to create, update, or delete objects
displayed in the view, but not the view itself, the user can only
read what is displayed and cannot do anything with the
displayed data. Similarly, if the user has access to the view but
not to create, update, or delete objects displayed in the view,
the data in the view is read-only.
Configuration
Workbench and
Administration Tool
For users to access the Configuration Workbench and
Administration Tool, they must have a profile with appropriate
form permissions.
8.6 PASSWORD MANAGEMENT
Encompass provides a rich set of password management options reflecting typical corporate
security policies. These allow for the definition and enforcement of:
• The number of failed attempts to log in to the user account before the account is locked
• The number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive
failed login attempts
• The number of days the same password can be used for authentication. The password
expires if it is not changed within this period, and further connections are rejected
• The number of grace period days during which a warning is issued and login is allowed. If
the password is not changed during the grace period, the password expires
• The number of days before which a password cannot be reused
• The number of password changes required before the current password can be reused

8.6.1 SELF-SERVICE PASSWORD RESET
Self-service password reset allows users that have the capability enabled to initiate a
password reset from the Customer Management Login page.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 116

Figure 59: Login Page with Forgot Password Link
On receiving a self-service password reset request, Encompass generates a security token
with an expiry duration. The expiry duration and user notification method are configurable.
The user enters the security token and new password details to reset their password.

Figure 60: Password Reset with Security Token
8.7 ENCRYPTION
Encompass supports field level data encryption of entity data. This enables the protection of
sensitive data such as credit card information, VIP contact information or sensitive operational
data such as system passwords. This includes the ability to mask or partially mask sensitive
data displayed in the GUI. The mask is configurable, and some of the data can be visible (for
example, the last four digits of a credit card number). Partially revealed data can be used for
security checks while keeping the data secure.
In addition to the Encompass core encryption capabilities, Encompass has been enabled to use
Oracle Transparent Data Encryption. This Oracle functionality allows the encryption of
database columns, providing a comprehensive security solution for database traffic, backups
and exports. This optional capability requires the purchase of an Oracle Advance Security
license.
8.8 SECURE FILE TRANSFERS
There are processes in which a user is required to send or retrieve files from Encompass, for
example viewing an invoice image. In Encompass, these file transfers between server and
client are done using a secure framework.
First the security model ensures that only authorized users can perform file transfers. Files are
then transferred via a secure Transaction Engine connection. All file transfer information is
logged for auditing purposes.

8.9 SINGLE SIGN-ON
Encompass provides server single sign-on capabilities and support for Microsoft Active
Directory authentication. This enables Encompass clients to interact with an external
company-wide authentication system.
This “silent logon” can be turned on/off dependent on whether external authentication
software is used.
In addition, Customer Connect and Customer Management support enhanced single sign-on
functionality where users need not explicitly log in if they are already authenticated by their
work environment. That is, when users access Customer Connect and Customer Management
from a third party application, they are automatically logged in, and the Customer Connect
and Customer Management Home page is displayed.

Figure 61: Single Sign-On
Encompass also includes support for SAML Single Sign-on for the Process Engine Rest
adapter and Convergent Billing client using Business & Administration Studio as the web
authentication server provider.Authentication Methods
Encompass supports a number of external authentication methods allowing user names and
passwords to be managed by external applications. Those supported include:
• Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) integration into Encompass enables
authentication of users via many different low level authentication methods. For
example, a user may be authenticated via LDAP or RSA Secure ID. When a user
supplies their user name and password to authenticate access to Encompass, the
details are sent from the client to the Authentication server. The Authentication server
then sends these credentials via a PAM plug-in to an external system for validation,
prior to allowing the user to connect
• Kerberos authentication protocol. Kerberos provides the basis for Encompass single
sign-on support, using the Microsoft Active Directory implementation of Kerberos
• Security Assertion Markup Language (
• ) is an open standard that implements a secure method of passing user
authentications and authorisations between identity providers (IdP) and service
providers (SP). When a user logs into a SAML enabled application, the SP requests
authorisation from the appropriate IdP. The IdP authenticates the user’s credentials
and then returns the authorisation for the user to the SP, and the user is then able to
use the application

Encompass also provides authenticated file transfer. This is the ability to securely retrieve files
generated by server processes for viewing locally on the Windows PC and the ability to send
files to the server in a secure manner from the local PC.
8.10 PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARD (PCI-DSS)
The Payment Card Industry has developed a standard for the secure handling of cardholder
information for debit and credit cards. This standard defines controls around cardholder data
to reduce credit card fraud via exposure of this data to unauthorized individuals.
Encompass provides a number of security features enabling Encompass deployment projects
to comply with PCI-DSS. These are described below.
Data Encryption
Fields containing sensitive data can be encrypted in the database with only authorized users
able to decrypt the data. Encrypted data can also be returned partially decrypted with a mask
applied. Separate security privileges control whether a user can view fully decrypted data,
only decrypted data with a mask applied, or has no access to the data.
Data Auditing
All successful and unsuccessful attempts to view decrypted data are logged in a configurable
format including details of the user who accessed the data and details on the client and IP
address used by the client. The logs can be configured so that they are centrally stored
externally to Encompass.
Suppression of sensitive data from debug output
Encompass tags all data that is sensitive and automatically suppresses its output from log
messages and debug traces.
Network Encryption
All communications between the Encompass clients and server can be encrypted so that
sensitive information is never visible on the network.

9. ENCOMPASS REPORTING
Encompass includes a set of core reports covering the entire customer lifecycle. The reports
are delivered using the Encompass XML Report tool, with the output format being either HTML
for intranet publishing or printing; or spread sheet for manipulating in Microsoft Excel.
The diagram below illustrates the available reports.

Figure 62: Encompass Reports

The Encompass XML Report tool is part of the Encompass license and can be used to create
new reports to address any specific business needs. The Encompass XML Report tool can
generate reports in Excel XML or HTML format. In addition, any external tool that supports the
database in use can be used for reporting on the created views. The reporting environment
uses scheduling to create tasks that the system then runs.
Reports can be scheduled for a particular time or produced immediately. If scheduled, one or
more tasks are created (depending on the schedule parameters specified) and run to generate
the report at the dates and times specified.

10. ENCOMPASS SCALABILITY
Scalability supports the ability to handle increasing workloads through the addition of
hardware such as CPUs, memory, disk, network and extra machines. Scalability is often
classified into two broad categories – horizontal scalability and vertical scalability. Horizontal
scalability refers to the ability of the application to increase performance by distributing the
application across multiple physical hardware nodes. Vertical scalability refers to the ability of
an application to increase performance as additional computing resources are added to a
single physical hardware node. Encompass has the ability to scale in both ways.
Encompass is certified on Oracle Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SecurityEnhanced Linux (SELinux). The Linux certification enables Encompass to be supported on lowcost commodity hardware using x86 based Intel Xeon processors. Low-cost hardware ensures
that Encompass scalability is achieved at a very competitive cost.
10.1 HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY
Encompass supports full horizontal scalability of the application for high volume deployments.
The diagram below shows a typical multi-instance deployment with four physical instances.
Each instance manages a subset of the customer base.

Figure 63: Horizontal Scalability
10.2 VERTICAL SCALABILITY
Encompass supports vertical scalability through the following architectural attributes:
• 64-bit rating / Commerce Engine caches to avoid database queries during rating
• Support for in-memory reservations – reservations are created in cache memory to avoid
the overhead of inserting into the database during Call Authorization
• Data partitioning to maximize database performance
• Multi-process architecture, using the Transaction Engine for load distribution
• Stateless OLTP processing, using the Transaction Engine for database connection pooling

10.3 VIRTUALIZATION AND CONTAINERS
Hardware virtualization using partitioning and software virtualization using virtual machines
are supported by Encompass and described in more detail below. How this applies to a
deployment is dependent on a number of factors including the hardware platform being used,
operating system as well as data volumes.
Partitioning
This is where a single server is partitioned at a hardware level into multiple partitions. To the
operating system, each partition looks like a separate server. Oracle databases support this
type of virtualization. With Encompass, partitioning is most often used to support having an
application server and database server as separate partitions running on a single server, but
can also be used to host a Encompass system in different partitions. Encompass supports all
hardware based partitioning options provided by HP, Oracle and IBM.
Virtual Machines
Virtual machine technology uses virtualization at a software level to allow multiple instances of
an operating system to run on a server. This form of virtualization is most relevant for Linux
x86-based servers which do not support hardware-based partitioning. Encompass is supported
on VMWare ESXi virtual machine technology.
Containers
Encompass application servers can be deployed via containers utilizing Kubernetes
orchestration. This architecture can be utilized to support high availability as well as horizontal
scalability of the application servers
For performance reasons, Encompass production systems utilize the Oracle ASM (Automatic
Storage Management) file system for the Oracle database. As Oracle does not support ASM
running inside of a container, a container deployment for the database server is not supported
for production systems. For non-production systems that do not have a critical performance
requirement (e.g., development, functional testing), the EC database server can be deployed
via a container.
10.4 ENCOMPASS IN KUBERNETES
Encompass supports the deployment and management of Encompass clusters in a Kubernetes
environment. It provides a Helm chart and a set of container images that can be used to
deploy an Encompass cluster to Kubernetes. The Encompass cluster can consist of Convergent
Billing and Process Engine, as well as Business & Administration Studio, Customer Connect,
TREREST inbound, Email inbound, and Process Engine web client.
Running Encompass in Kubernetes offers several benefits including:
• Predictable and consistent deployment of Encompass across different environments
• Self-healing capabilities to automatically recover from failures
• Built-in high availability and scaling capabilities
10.5 CLOUD AND ON-PREMISE DEPLOYMENT
Encompass can be deployed on hardware in your data center, in a CSG data center and in the
cloud.
Encompass is supported in the AWS public cloud but remains cloud agnostic in terms of tools
and utilities so that other cloud providers can also be used. CSG customers are live in
production using a number of different cloud providers.

11. ENCOMPASS INTEROPERABILITY
A billing and transaction management system cannot stand on its own in the organization.  It
communicates and shares data and processes with other systems. These systems and
processes can be internal or external to the organization.
Integration with other systems enables sharing of data and processes so that the organization
gets the maximum benefits from having a powerful billing and transaction server. These
benefits include:
• Automating business processes
• Increasing the speed and efficiency of business processes
• Allowing different systems to be the owners of data and sharing this data when needed
with other systems. For example, if an external CRM system is used, it can hold the
customer details and can update the billing system when these change
• Expanding business process automation and data sharing to beyond the organization

Figure 64: Integration Components
Encompass has an open architecture that enables integration and interoperability with both
sources external and internal to the organization.
Integration with external sources includes the ability to participate in Internet-initiated
transactions, for example:
• Business to Business processes
• Web self-care
Integration with internal sources includes the ability to communicate with:
• BSS systems, such as CRM or Order management, Financials, and Payment systems
• OSS systems, for example network switches, provisioning systems and short-messageservice platforms (SMSCs)

• Encompass provides adapters and an integration SDK that enables interoperability in
multiple ways. This gives choices in how Encompass is integrated in an organization
Encompass integration is based on a few key principles:
• Components in the Encompass suite are fully integrated up-front, maximizing the benefit
of buying more than one. This eliminates integration risk and cost
• Encompass is built around a Transaction Engine (TRE). The TRE enables entity level and
business level functions to be exposed to external systems. The functions can then be
invoked directly from external programs or across an integration layer. All functions in the
system, including user defined functions, can be exposed through the TRE
• The Encompass Interoperability tools build on the flexibility of the TRE to provide predefined business level functions, data entity validation, a data model for Encompass,
REST, SOAP and Kafka adapters
11.1 INTERNAL INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE
Encompass is the first integrated, real-time customer management and convergent rating and
billing solution designed from the ground-up. Pre-integration of billing with Customer Connect
and Customer Management provides the user with full knowledge of the customer's products
and services, contact history, and account information all from a single source. This avoids
duplication and synchronization of data as well as reducing on-going maintenance costs.
Encompass internal integration architecture encompasses:
• Convergent Rating and Billing
• Customer Connect
• Customer Management
• Commerce Engine
11.2 EXTERNAL INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE
Encompass has frequently been selected as an element within a larger ecosystem. Encompass
has well developed integration capabilities, with an architecture that is based upon the notion
that it can:
• Share ownership of data with other applications. A customer's name and address could,
for instance, be "owned" by the CRM system, with Encompass being updated when it
changes. Conversely, Encompass could "own" the account balance and update other
elements, for example, an Intelligent Network SCP platform, when it changed
• Participate in business processes that are larger than itself. Encompass must be aware of
the existence of these outside elements and that in certain cases it will drive their
operation, while in other instances these applications will drive Encompass's operation
Encompass can share data and participate in business processes as it is built on a real-time,
extensible framework, with intrinsic support for integration.

Figure 65: Integration Model
Surrounding the Encompass core application is an extensive set of fully documented lower
level APIs. These API's are wrapped by a set of integration enablers that provide a business
level interface to Encompass and speak the language of the broader BSS/OSS. These
integration enablers incorporate data entity validation that automatically checks that inbound
data is consistent with the configured Encompass business model.
Encompass exposes its low level and business level APIs as integration points to the
organization. These can then be directly accessed through programming APIs (Java, C++,
Windows DLLs, or Perl) and across a messaging layer.
Once the lower level integration and connectivity details are established, the higher-level data
mappings and integration processes between systems are defined. The Encompass data model
provides an easily readable model to assist in the understanding and modelling of Encompass
in the organization. The model assists with both data mapping and the definition of integration
processes.
The details of the Encompass integration architecture are discussed in the subsections below.
11.2.1 ENCOMPASS WEB SERVICES ADAPTER
CSG offers the Encompass Web Services Adapter, a Java adapter for handling outbound and
inbound SOAP or REST requests.
This adapter gives access to all Encompass functions, including business level APIs available
for OSS integration. The OAuth 2.0 protocol is supported for API authorization.
The adapter supports interactions where Encompass is invoked from another system, for
example, account balance fetch from a CRM system, and where Encompass invokes another
system, for example, credit check to a credit scoring application.

11.2.2 ENCOMPASS KAFKA ADAPTERS
Apache Kafka is a distributed high performance reliable messaging platform. The Encompass
Kafka adapters allow Encompass to publish messages to Kafka and receive messages from
Kafka on configured topics.
Separate inbound and outbound adapters are provided in one package. Both adapters can
connect to Kafka using TCP or SSL. SSL connections provide support for data encryption and
mutual authentication.
The Kafka inbound adapter subscribes to one or more Kafka topics. It receives messages from
Kafka on these topics, converts them from the specified Kafka message format into TRE
format, and sends each message to Encompass as a TRE request.
The Kafka outbound adapter receives TRE requests from Encompass, converts them into the
specified Kafka message format and publishes the messages to Kafka on the requested topic.
The Confluent Platform is a commercial offering built on top of Apache Kafka. Messages
published and consumed on this platform must use the Confluent AVRO binary message
format and use AVRO Schemas that are available in the Confluent Schema Registry.
The Kafka adapters support communicating with the Confluent Platform using the required
message format.
11.2.3 ENCOMPASS KAFKA ADAPTERS
The HTTP/2 Commerce Engine adapters handle communication between Encompass and an
external HTTP/2 service or client, allowing Encompass to publish and consume HTTP/2 web
services.
Separate inbound and outbound adapters are provided in one package. Both adapters can
connect using TCP or Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS connections provide support for data
encryption and mutual authentication. The HTTP/2 adapters support sending and receiving
messages in JSON format with automatic conversion to/from the Encompass native EPM data
types. The adapters provide generic functionality that is used by Encompass codepacks and
bespoke implementations using web services.
11.2.4 ENCOMPASS INTEGRATION SERVICE ENABLERS (INTEGRATION SDK)
Coupled with the SOAP and REST adapters are an extensive set of integration enablers and a
knowledge base to assist in the provision of integration services. The integration tools
provided with Encompass provide logical inbound and outbound interfaces into and out of the
system for real time and batch transactions. External Definitions and Interface Definitions are
the two components of the tool used to achieve this.
These integration enablers include:
• The Encompass data model
• Encompass Composite Business Functions (CBFs)
• Encompass External Definitions and Interface Definitions
• Encompass Entity Validation Server (EVS)

Encompass Data Model
The data model diagram maps out the high-level entity relationships in Encompass. It enables
the integrator to understand the data Encompass requires and the order in which Encompass
expects such data. This assists in:
• Understanding the configuration changes that can be made in Encompass to support the
local business processes.
• Documenting localized Encompass configuration to facilitate the knowledge transfer
between configuration and integration teams.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

• Creating organization wide business processes that incorporate Encompass through
modelling the business process flow and transaction data touch points.
• Enabling a systems integrator to map data between Encompass and other systems.
The data model is provided in HTML representation for easy reading and navigation.
Encompass Composite Business Functions
The Encompass Composite Business Functions are a set of functions that enable CRM-style
interactions with Encompass at a business level. The underlying complexities of the interaction
and the execution sequence are hidden in easy-to-use business level functions.
Composite Business Functions exist for creating, modifying and deleting customer and product
instance details in Encompass, and can access multiple system entities.
The Composite Business Functions use the Encompass entity validation server to ensure that
all data entered is internally consistent with the Encompass configuration specific to a
deployment.
Encompass External Definitions

Figure 66: External Definitions Interface
External definitions are used to map the data models of external systems to the Encompass
data model. The external definition defines the structure of fields that must be supplied to or
from a remote system, and how they map to Encompass objects and their fields. The external
definition can be used to define create, read, search, update and delete operations on
Encompass data. Validation of the data is automatically handled by Encompass Entity
Validation.
Each external definition maps to a Convergent Billing entity or a Customer Connect/Customer
Management class. External definitions can be linked to create complex structures covering
multiple objects. A Encompass object can have multiple external definitions allowing a
different view to be presented to different external systems.
External definitions can be generated from XML schema files and XML schema files can be
generated from external definitions.

ENCOMPASS 12
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CSG Confidential & Proprietary Information | Copyright ©2022 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its Affiliates  Page 128

Encompass Interface Definitions
Interface definitions define how an external system accesses Encompass data. They centralize
all the configuration and information needed to define the physical interface, including the
type, protocol, the set of accessible external definitions, and the security semantics.  With
these capabilities, Encompass supports SOAP-based real-time interface configuration or flat
file (e.g. CSV) or structured file (e.g. XML) batch integration without requiring any coding.
Interface Definitions also provide integration auditing capabilities, for example, which objects
were transferred to/from an interface, plus tools that manage the transfer of batch files
to/from the Encompass system while checking for duplicate files and checksums/hashing
support for tamper protection.
Example
For example, defining a “Create Customer Records” loader in Encompass from data stored in a
CSV file requires an external definition that maps the positional fields in the CSV file to
Encompass attributes, then an interface definition that defines the directory and filename
format of the input file, plus a mapping to the created external definition.  Users then load
their file by executing a Encompass schedule.
Encompass Entity Validation Server (EVS)
Encompass Entity Validation is a set of functions that are automatically created to match the
rules configured for a particular deployment. These functions are designed to validate that the
Composite Business Functions are invoked with parameters that match the internal
configuration rules for the Encompass deployment. Entity Validation provides the same set of
business checks as those used in the Encompass GUI, thus enabling safe direct access from
external CRM systems.
11.2.5 TMF-ALIGNED APIS
To further enable Encompass to interoperate with other ecosystem modules in an Open Digital
Architecture, Encompass has a suite of packaged TMF-aligned APIs that enables it to integrate
with other components. Many of the APIs are certified and CSG is an active participant in the
TM Forum. Internally, some CSG modules are integrated using TMF APIs as they can be
deployed either as independent, best of breed components or pre-integrated into a best of
suite solution.
11.2.6 BATCH FILE PROCESSING
Encompass provides a flexible solution for file management, processing, and transfers or batch
files. The solution comprises the following components:
File Processing Manager
The File Processing Manager (FPM) is a file processing management system responsible for
maintaining files that are received into (inbound files) or generated by (outbound files)
Encompass. FPM is inward facing and focused on the interaction between Encompass and the
local file system. FPM provides self-managing control logic to maintain, create, and audit files,
which allows remote processes to have no knowledge of how the file system works. FPM can
use configuration from interface definitions that includes file name creation and automatic file
movement.

Figure 67: File Processing Manager
Batch Extractor
The batch extractor provides preconfigured support to extract Encompass data to a file. The
batch extractor is driven from a schedule, command line, or one-off task (inheriting properties
from an interface definition), which extracts a set of data to a specified file format.
Batch Loader
The batch loader provides the ability to load files into Encompass based on the parameters
defined in an interface definition. The batch loader is driven from a schedule, command line,
or one-off task (inheriting properties from an interface definition), which parses a file or set of
files into individual records and performs an external definition operation for each record.

Performance  / Storage Capability Notice
This document details CSG’s recommended estimates for production hardware storage and performance factor values which are based upon CSG’s
assumptions and the Customer’s estimated volumes and proposed operations.
Any recommendation provided by CSG is based upon performance benchmark results of a typical configuration with synthesized data sets, and the
Customer should be aware that its system may be delivered with customizations to the configuration which may lead to different performance
characteristics. Further, if a detailed operational design review of the system is carried out by CSG, as part of a Specification Study procured by the
Customer under a duly executed Statement of Work, it may also identify business requirements which impact on the estimated sizing of the
recommended production hardware.
In the event the Customer procures CSG’s services to complete a “Hardware Composition Report” for the production hardware, CSG will not be able
to provide a production hardware performance warranty, particularly where the factor values during the actual use of the system do not conform
to the associated estimated factor values set out in the “Hardware Composition Report”. In addition, performance standards or characteristics
relating to the volume of transactions or speed of transaction handling shall not be warranted, unless such standards or characteristics are
expressly included in the Specifications for the Software, and CSG expressly agrees to such in a valid and binding agreement entered between CSG
and the Customer.

1 PURPOSE
 The purpose of this document  is to:
• Specify the scope of functionality  and business processes supported by the CSG solution.
• Define the solution functionality  to a level of detail sufficient to facilitate downstream  program
activities such as feature inception, solution  design and acceptance testing.
1.1 OUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE BSS
MODERNIZATION
The Freedom's Modernization  project is a strategic initiative  designed to enhance Freedom Mobile's
infrastructure and operational efficiency. The primary objectives of this project include achieving a lower
total cost of ownership, meeting  growth  objectives, and improving  operational efficiencies. By leveraging
cloud and containerization technologies,  the project aims to streamline infrastructure, enabling  faster
time to market and greater agility through  the Product-Offer  Model. Additionally, the modernization effort
seeks to provide a more intuitive customer care and activation experience via the Customer Connect
platform. The scope of the project involves the transition from the current Singleview V10 system to a new
version, Encompass, hosted on the CSG Cloud. Freedom Mobile currently utilizes CSG’s Singleview
Software. The modernization project aims to implement the new version with minimal customization,
adhering as closely as possible to 'out of the box' functionality.  This approach includes multiple releases
for testing  purposes before a single, comprehensive release for production.
The proposed solution  is a pre-integrated suite of CSG components, which includes Encompass
Convergent Billing, Customer Connect, Commerce Engine, Business & Administration Studio, Convergent
Mediation (AMM), and Intermediate. This comprehensive suite is designed to work together  to provide a
cohesive and efficient operational  framework for Freedom Mobile.
1.2 ABOUT THE SOLUTION
The solution  consists of a pre-integrated suite of CSG components, including  Encompass Convergent
Billing, Customer Connect, Commerce Engine, Convergent  Mediation (AMM), Intermediate, and Business &
Administration  Studio.
The solution  includes a detailed mapping  of interfaces between components  and external systems,
ensuring robust  communication  and data exchange. This includes REST and SOAP APIs for seamless
integration  with existing  systems at Freedom.

2.1.1 CSG  APPLICATIONS AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS
2.1.1.1 ENCOMPASS
CSG Encompass is at the heart of the proposed  solution and is the customer rating,  charging, billing,  and
product  data repository that serves all other components  of the solution.
2.1.1.1.1 ENCOMPASS CONVERGENT BILLING
Encompass Convergent Billing ('Convergent Billing') has been designed for next generation real-time
rating, billing  and customer care environments, to increase competitive advantage by making  it easier to
design, deliver, rate and bill the products and services customers want. Convergent  Billing provides
modules for real-time rating, discounting,  and bill production.
Convergent Billing provides:
• Flexibility  to rate transactions in real-time or batch modes, using a variety of combination  of
parameters, to support Freedom’s product bundles  and pricing  options.
• Real-time processing to generate charges; parallel processing of all charges for any or all
transactions to provide timely information  on revenue and liabilities for accurate, informed
decision making.
• Product  modelling capability, enabling  easier design and implementation  of new products
and services
• Flexible design of business rules that enables Freedom to configure  the solution  to reflect
evolution  in their business models (due to company growth  or technological advances)
2.1.1.1.2 ENCOMPASS CUSTOMER CONNECT
Encompass Customer Connect  is the  Out  of the  Box  (OOTB) user interface that  complements Encompass
deployments.  It  provides  customer  acquisition,  order  handling,  billing  care features  to  support  the Call
Center & Sales Agent.  Customer Connect is pre-integrated  with Encompass and shares important  items of
configuration  and operational information.
Customer Connect draws on many years of practical CRM system deployments to provide an OOTB solution
with embedded “best practice” to help your Agents:
• Interact more efficiently with customers and proactively resolve customer issues
• Up-sell more effectively from the Call Centre.
Customer  Connect helps  your Agents  manage Freedom’s relationship  with  customers  through  the  entire
customer life cycle.
Customer Connect provides four main functional  components:
• Customer Information  Management - Gather customer information  necessary to establish
and maintain the customer 360° view; contact details, hierarchies, preferences and historical
information  such as cases, orders, purchased products and contact points.  Provide
integration into 3rd party systems such as identity  management systems. Also provides
troubleshooting  and service request handling in response to customer’s enquiries.
• Order Handling – Manage a customer’s order through negotiations and configuration and
pricing stages, initiating  ordering,  performing  order handling  tasks through  to completion
and tracking order and ordered product history.  Covers initial provisioning,  updates to
services through child-offers, relocations and terminations. The final step is the initiation  of
billing.

• Billing Care – Serve a customer’s billing query including any actions relating to bill and invoice
payment, balances, voucher, entitlements,  disputes and adjustments. Also includes plan
changes, change of ownership,  collections, treatments and terminations,  device replacement
and suspension.
• Retail Experience – Deployment of a subset of Customer Connect information  to support  the
Sales Agents in retail locations to interact efficiently with  your customers
2.1.1.1.3 ENCOMPASS COMMERCE ENGINE
The solution will leverage the current Freedom Commerce Engine im plementation with no or lim ited
m odifications.
Encompass Commerce Engine supports:
• A common highly  scalable transaction charging framework for all types of customer accounts
including prepaid, postpaid. or hybrid.  All types of customer accounts are managed in the
same way, with the account policy determining whether a service is restricted.
• Interactive and real-time service authorization, authentication,  and accounting (AAA) to limit
fraud and other revenue loss.
• Flexible policy management, performing  service information-based credit control.
• Concurrent account usage - allows multiple devices and services to draw on the same
account, providing  opportunities  for attractive, flexible offerings.
• Dynamic account selection - enables customers to add charges to an account of their choice.
• Customer controlled  policies - customers can specify service and account-specific spending
limits and notification  preferences.
• Real-time rating – for revenue assurance and processing efficiency.
• The ability to eliminate any single point  of failure of the balance manager when  installed with
the high availability configuration.
• Flexibility - all customers can be offered the same level of service regardless of the method of
payment.
• Long Running  Session Charging
• Seamless Handover
• Reservation Expiry Auto-Debit
2.1.1.1.4 ENCOMPASS BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION STUDIO
Business & Administration  Studio is a web-based client that enables business users to create and maintain
product  or market offers without  needing IT support.  The system is installed with the Encompass server
software and no files need to be installed on the end user Windows  PC.
As a web browser client application  Business & Administration Studio  can be used via a PC or tablet.
Business & Administration  Studio provides a web-based drag-and-drop  client through  which new market
offers and bundles can be assembled and configured.

2.1.1.2 CSG INTERMEDIATE
This component  is already in use at Freedom, the Encompass solution  will reuse from the current
implementation  with  limited changes. No new implementations  are being proposed  concerning CSG
Intermediate. Intermediate will no longer send roaming  records to Encompass for the rating of roaming
agreements as the plan is that Interconnect (contracted separately) will be performing this functionality
going  forward. CSG understands that there are non-customer impacting events from the GW_EVENT event
source that are being sent to Singleview in the current solution. CSG recommends that the new
Encompass solution  no longer be sent these events and Intermediate will be completely decoupled from
Encompass solution.   Further discussion with Freedom is needed to determine if these events are still
required to be stored in the Encompass database or if there is a better solution.
2.1.1.3 CSG  CONVERGENT  MEDIATION (AMM)
This component  is already in use at Freedom, the Encompass solution  will be reused from the current
implementation  with  no or limited changes. No changes or new implementations  are being proposed
concerning CSG Convergent Mediation.
2.1.1.4 CSG  INTERACTIVATE
This component  is already in use at Freedom, the Encompass solution  will be reused from the current
implementation  with  no or limited changes. No changes or new implementations  are being proposed
concerning CSG Interactivate.
2.1.1.5 CSG  SCP
This component  is already in use at Freedom, the Encompass solution  will be reused from the current
implementation  with  no or limited changes. No changes or new implementations  are being proposed
concerning CSG SCP.
2.1.1.6 ZSCALER PRIVATE  ACCESS
Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) is a cloud-native security platform designed to provide comprehensive security
solutions  for organisations in an increasingly cloud-centric and mobile world. Its core functions  revolve
around enhancing  cyber security, ensuring secure access to applications and data, and simplifying  the
management of network and security policies.
2.1.2 CSG’S FOCUS ON INDUSTRY STANDARDS
CSG is focused on Industry  Standards such as TM Forum and ISO. CSG has been an active member of the
TM Forum for over 15 years and is represented in many TMF workgroups.  CSG have invested in
conformance of our solutions  with the TMF Frameworx and ODA standards. CSG is a signatory to both TM

3 SOLUTION SCOPE
The following  sections detail the scope of the Freedom solution provided  by CSG. This new implementation
is not intended  to replicate the current Singleview system at Freedom. Instead, it aims to fulfil Freedom’s
business requirements and align Freedom with the Encompass roadmap, addressing the large technical
upgrades they currently face due to their highly  customized system. By moving  to a roadmap-aligned
solution,  Freedom may need to adjust some business processes and functional aspects of the current
solution to align with  the core product  functionality.  Any required functionality  not currently part of the
core solution  will follow  a strict enhancement process governed by CSG Product Management. This
process includes the submission  of enhancement requests by Freedom, followed  by evaluation,
acceptance, prioritization,  development,  and release by the CSG Product Management team. New or
updated products and functionality which are implemented in Freedom’s Singleview production  stream
after September of 2024 or during  this Encompass modernization  project timeframe will follow a BAU,
change control, or enhancement  process to ensure that they are represented in the new solution.
Freedom and the teams working on the current Singleview implementation will conduct joint requirement
and design sessions with the Encompass implementation  team to ensure that changes to Singleview align
with the Encompass solution  being implemented.
3.1.1 BAU CHANGES  ON SINGLEVIEW
As indicated above BAU changes to Freedom’s existing Singleview solution that have occurred from
September or 2024 will potentially  need to be included  in the current modernization  solution where
applicable.  This section identifies those BAU changes that will need to be incorporated  in the new
Encompass solution,  each change has been categorized as to how the change will be incorporated
(Change request required, incorporated into an existing use-case, or already supported by the new
solution).

3.13.2 PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
3.1.13.2.1 PRODUCT CATALOGUE MANAGEMENT
This section describes the following:
• Product Catalogue capabilities: An overview of the solution’s product catalogue capabilities,
how it structures the products and pricing, and the mechanisms that enable the catalogue to
be flexible and manageable by Freedom.
• Product lifecycle management: An overview of the solution’s product catalogue lifecycle
capabilities.
• Products and additional  components:  The products and services, and pricing to be configured
for Freedom.
• Business and Administration Studio:  The web-based tool  for creating and maintaining product
offers, pricing  and reference data.
The Product Catalogue centralizes information about  product offerings and product  components.
Components  within Encompass can be mixed and matched as required, and constraints and limits
centrally managed, to create highly innovative  customer offerings to match marketing offers. This
centrally managed catalogue facilitates agility and the ability to customize and personally tailor potential
customers’ packages at point of sale.
Commented [CH5]: This section needs to be completed
with the list of BAU changes.

The standard functionality  of CSG Encompass will be delivered based on the following:
• CSG Encompass’s product catalogue will be the master from a charging, rating, billing and
financial perspective.
• CSG Encompass’s product catalogue will be maintained using the CSG Business and
Administration  Studio.
• Freedom will perform a product  rationalization initiative prior to the definition  stage to limit the
number of market offers to be configured  in the new solution. Freedom will actively participate in
mapping  their existing  rate plans to market offers configured in the new solution.
• For the proposed solution,  CSG will implement  the 40 Wireless market offers, each market offer
will represent one actively sold rate plan in Freedom’s current solution. In addition, CSG will
implement a generic market offer to represent rate plans that have active subscriptions but are
no longer available for sale to support the migration of grandfathered rate plans.
•

New or updated products which are implemented in Freedom’s production  stream during this
modernization  project will follow  a BAU, change control, or enhancement process to ensure that they are
represented in the new solution.
3.1.1.13.2.1.1 PRODUCT CATALOGUE CAPABILITIES
3.1.1.1.13.2.1.1.1 PRODUCT OFFERS
A Product Offer is the primary element within Encompass that defines a customer offering.
Product  Offers encapsulate the basic product and service/equipment elements required for a product  and
allow the definition  of all required information  such as the pricing book,  compatible additional elements
(options or extras), restrictions, bundling  discounts and pricing elements (including  bonuses and
entitlements) and selling rules.
Offers can be arranged into multi-level hierarchies (for example see Figure 4Figure 4). Selection criteria
such as mandatory/optional  selections, min/max, eligibility and availability period can be defined for
specific Product Offers. Each product offer can also be assigned to a category (from a configurable set of
categories), which can be used for example in the ordering process where applicable.

FIGURE 4: PRODUCT OFFER  HIERARCHY

Overall, Product  Offers allows quick and easy modelling of marketing  offers within  a central Product
Catalogue, ensuring that from order entry to provisioning  all product-related information  is correctly
captured and distributed, marketing’s selling rules are captured and enforced, and that upselling
opportunities  are always presented.
Importantly,  the concept of a Product  Offer allows a high degree of flexibility in defining  the Product
Catalogue as Offers can be built with a myriad of combinations.  These Product Offers can then be reused
within  the context of other Product  Offers in the system. Furthermore, it allows the Agent at selling time to
pick and choose the elements of the Offer that an individual  customer wants, within  a process governed
by custom selling rules. This allows Freedom to develop product  offers that are unique to the market and
can be customized to the requirements of the customer during  a sale/order.
3.1.1.1.23.2.1.1.2 PRODUCT CATALOGUE ELEMENTS
3.1.1.1.2.13.2.1.1.2.1 Charging Model and Methods
Integral to the concept of a market offer is pricing  and charging. Encompass provides a flexible and
powerful  structure that will support Freedom’s charging and pricing model now and into the future.
Price Books (pricing and rate and charge algorithms for pricing and rating) will be held in a collection of
mapping  tables and reference data tables maintainable by Freedom. Price Books can be associated with
the relevant Product Offers.
Charging methods that can be associated with Price Books are:
• Usage Charges
• Periodic recurring charges.
• Non-recurring  charges.
• Discounts.

• Entitlements (also known  as free units).
The specifics of the charging methods supported  for Freedom are outlined  in the relevant section of this
document, 3.4.33.3.3 Charge Calculation and Balance Management.
3.1.1.1.2.23.2.1.1.2.2 Bundling
Product  bundling  allows Freedom to offer variable pricing or include a discount  based on the combination
of products purchased by the customer. Encompass has the capability for product charging  components
to be bundled  together to offer the customer an incentive to purchase multiple products.
Product  Offers and Price Books support  this capability by allowing the definition  of pricing overrides by
optional  child Offers. For example, purchase of a child offer that includes additional  products might
override the monthly  recurring charge used on the primary offer.
In addition to price differences facilitated by Offer Price Books, bundling  discounts can be applied to a
specific product,  or made available for consumption  by all services on a customer account.
The specifics of the discounts supported  for Freedom are outlined  in the relevant section(s) of this
document.
3.1.1.1.33.2.1.1.3 PRODUCT CATALOGUE FEATURES
The following  product  features are provided to define the market offer business rules.
3.1.1.1.3.13.2.1.1.3.1 Real-Time Charging Features
The supported  real-time charges are:
• Real-time one-off charge: Generates an activation charge or cancellation charge when the
associated market offer or bundle  is sold or cancelled. The charge amount,  general ledger
guidance rules and tax rules are determined from reference data tables.  They can be used
with prepaid accounts as they can be configured  to perform an account authorization  prior to
charging.  They can also be tied to provisioning  where the provisioning  action must be
successful before the charge is applied.
• Real-time periodic charge: Generates a periodic charge for the associated market offer or
bundle.  It can also create an associated recurring usage allowance. The charge amount,
periodicity,  general ledger guidance rules and tax rules are determined from reference data
tables. Like the one-off charges, this feature can also be used with prepaid accounts and can
also be tied to provisioning.
• Instalment charges: Generates a fixed number  of charges over time periods of either hours,
days, or months.  If the feature is cancelled prior to all instalments being charged, then the
remaining instalments are charged as a single amount.
3.1.1.1.3.23.2.1.1.3.2 Batch Charging Features
The supported  batch charges are:
• Batch one-off charge: Generates activation or cancellation charges for market offers, bundles
or services. The charges are generated at bill generation time. The charge amount,  general
ledger guidance  rules and tax rules are determined from reference data tables. For further
details, see section One-off (Non-recurring) Charges.
• Batch recurring charge: Generates recurring charges for market offers, bundles or services.
The charges are generated at bill generation time. The charge amount,  general ledger
guidance rules and tax rules are determined from reference data tables.

3.1.1.1.3.2.13.2.1.1.3.2.1 Introductory Discounts On Recurring Charges
This is a fixed discount which  is applicable to all Customers. This discount  is set by Freedom at the offer
level as an introductory  or promotional discount on the recurring fee. This discount can be a fixed
monetary amount or percentage of the recurring fee for a certain period.
As an example, Freedom launches a new product  with a recurring fee of $20/month. To celebrate the
launch of this new product,  the marketing  team has decided to give subscribers a 50% discount on the
recurring fee that is applicable for the first 3 months. The promotion  is valid for all orders made within  30
days of the product  launch.
3.1.1.1.3.2.23.2.1.1.3.2.2 Negotiated Recurring And One-Off Charges
This feature allows for price overrides for recurring and one-off charges. This is mainly used for
Enterprise/Business customers. This feature will allow the salesperson to override standard recurring and
one-off charges for certain offers and products.
As an example, a Bank would  like to subscribe to a VPN offer. The standard pricing is $30/month per user.
The Bank wants a special price. Freedom agrees on $25 recurring fee. The price is overridden in the
Product  Catalogue. This recurring fee is only applicable to the Bank.
3.1.1.1.3.33.2.1.1.3.3 Freedom Handset Financing Plan
Device Installment
The solution will support bundled offers with  a device instalment feature included.  When a device
instalment charge is included  in a bundle offer and set to active then a recurring charge will be triggered
based on the instalment term configured  taking  any prepayment or other reductions into account.
Instalment term details for items can be configured  which include total amount  and number of
instalments. The instalment  amount will be calculated by deducting  any upfront  payment captured at the
time the order was taken.
The Subsidy amount is tracked for the term of the subscription and reduced on a bill cycle basis.
Encompass will maintain the financing and the subsidy balance in case the customer decides to cancel the
service or goes into treatment where the Financing and Subsidy balance needs to be charged on their
debtor/primary account.
The instalment charges will be charged in advance, and they will not be pro-rated. The total instalment
amount  can be decreased by taking in a mid-term payment in which case the remaining instalment
amounts will be recalculated e.g., Finance and subsidy  portion will be adjusted to reflect changes to the
outstanding  balance.
For Freedom, tax calculation is performed at the time of the monthly  invoice and applies solely to the
invoiced portion  of the financed amount.
In case the customer cancels the services or goes into treatment, the customer’s remaining amount will be
charged on his/her primary account.
The solution  will support defining and honoring  of ‘Tab’ room based on the customer type and credit
rating.
The calculation of the customer’s handset charge and subsidy amounts include various sub-components
which depend on the following:
• Rate Plan Groups and corresponding  subsidy amounts  for specific handset SKUs.
• ‘Trade In’ value of old phone (amount determined at the store) can reduce the handset due
amount
• Any promotion  available at that time on the old Traded In phone
Commented [CH6]: This section may be removed but
pending the promotion discussion.  Concern is controlling
eligibility and Security in the retail locations.

• Additional  promotion  available for specific period
Upfront payment by the customer can reduce the monthly  Financing  amount charged.
Remorse' period of 15/30 days in which the customer can cancel the service and return the handset (where
applicable) without  incurring any charges.
Leasing Plan – Trade Up
This functionality  provides the customer with  the option to return the handset when the contract period
ends + 1 month  grace period. In the event of the customer returning  the handset, no additional  charges
will be charged to the customer. However, if the customer decides to keep the handset, a pre-defined
amount  defined during contract signup  is charged on the next invoice (taxes on top).

It is assumed that Freedom manages their IFRS15 obligations and compliance outside of Encompass.
3.1.1.1.3.43.2.1.1.3.4 Usage Charging Features
Usage charging: generates charges for usage more than the customer’s allowances. The charge can vary
by:
• Event type and subtype e.g. voice, video, SMS, MMS, and data.
• Start time of call e.g. peak and off-peak.
• Destination based on dialed digit analysis e.g. on-net, off-net, national,  international,
premium rate numbers, and short codes.
• Call duration,  data volume or event count.
• Rounding  rules for the call duration  or volume (e.g. round  up to the next chargeable unit  such
as minute or Kbyte).
The feature is provided  in three variants:
• Base Usage Charge: Used for a base price plan. One Base Usage Charge per market offer is
allowed.
• Feature Usage Charge: Used for feature-level usage charges and provides an override to the
base price plan.
• Service Usage Charge: Used for service-level usage charges and provides an override to the
base price plan.
Other usage charging methods  include:
• Friends and Family charging: Generates discounted usage charges for calls to friends and
family numbers (including 100% discounts).  The maximum  number of friends and family
numbers per service is configurable based on the plan.
• Closed User Group charging: Generates discounted usage charges for calls to other
subscribers belonging  to the same closed user group (including  100% discounts). No
validation applied to CUG Identifier.
3.1.1.1.3.53.2.1.1.3.5 Flexi Recurring Charge (Elastic Charging)
The functionality  of Flexi Recurring Charge provides the Customer the benefit that instead of having fixed
recurring offers, they can opt for the Flexi Recurring offers which  is based on the usage.
Service Providers can decide on how much is Customer charged for a certain range of the usage of a
particular event type. Recurring charge will be derived depending  upon  the range in which the aggregated
usage falls.

For example, an operator sets ranges as below for voice national  events:
• 0 to 50 minutes - 10$
• 51 to 100 minutes - 15$
• 101 to 150 minutes - 20$
If a customer’s aggregated voice national usage is 120 minutes the customer is charged $20 as recurring
charge.
3.1.1.1.3.63.2.1.1.3.6 Term Based Pricing
Term Based Pricing refers to temporary pricing  for certain types of usage charges.  This is typically used to
offer subscribers cheaper prices for an initial period.  The following  term-based pricing scenarios are
supported:
• Special pricing for a fixed term on activation of the feature e.g. special pricing for the first two
months  after activation.
• Special pricing for a fixed term on activation of the feature, with a hard limit date after which
the special pricing is discontinued  e.g. special pricing for the first two months  after activation,
but hard limited to end on 1/7/2024.
• Special pricing for a fixed term but  only for certain days within  the term.  The fixed term is
divided into  recurring periods and only certain days within  each recurring period are eligible
for the special pricing e.g. fixed term for two months, but  the special pricing is only in effect
for the first two days in every seven within  the two-month  term.
3.1.1.1.3.73.2.1.1.3.7 Allowances (Free Units) Features
This feature supports:
• Free Units: Generates a usage allowance or spend allowance for a service. The allowance
amount,  validity period and unit  of measure (e.g. second, byte, currency) of the allowance are
determined from reference data tables.
• Shared Free Units: Generates an allowance shared between the customer and the customer’s
child customers (e.g. allowances shared by family members). The allowance amount,  validity
period and unit of measure covered by the allowance are determined from reference data
tables.
• Contributing  Shared Free Units: Allows service level allowances to be contributed  to a shared
pool of allowances that are available to a defined set of services within a customer hierarchy
e.g. each member of a four-person  family has a mobile with 2GB of included  data.  The data is
pooled together  so each family member has access to a total of 8 GB of shared data.  Limits
may also be configured  to limit the maximum  amount that each member of the shared
allowance may consume within  a defined period.
• Multi-device free units: Generates an allowance shared by the customer’s different mobile
services e.g. a phone and a 3G enabled tablet. The allowance amount,  validity period and unit
of measure covered by the allowance are determined from reference data tables.
3.1.1.1.3.113.2.1.1.3.8 Deposit Feature
This feature is used to require a deposit for a particular product bundle  or service.  The timeframe to keep
the deposit and the non-compounding  interest rate (if any) can be specified.
Under certain conditions,  deposits can be later applied to a customer’s debtor account or refunded  back.

3.1.1.1.3.123.2.1.1.3.9 Vacation Suspension
Vacation suspension refers to the temporary suspension of services for a subscriber for a period of time.
During the period of suspension,  recurring charges are either waived or applied at a reduced amount.
A common use case is where a subscriber is travelling on vacation for an extended period hence will not
be using their services and wishes to minimize their costs during  that time.
The Vacation feature provides a simple mechanism to support  temporary suspension of services.  It also
supports one-off charges at either the start and/or end of the suspension period.
Instalments will be charged even when the customer service is suspended. Subscribers can change or
cancel vacation suspension.  During this period,  the customer won't be able to use their suspended service,
e.g., data will be blocked.
The vacation period will not  extend the customers’ contract length,  nor will it change the customer’s
defined payment process. The vacation feature will only alter the customer’s monthly subscription
charges; it will not impact non-recurring  or instalment  charges that will still be generated during  the
vacation period.
Vacation suspension is activated by selling an offer containing  the Vacation feature.  When creating the
feature instance, the operator enters the start date and end date of the suspension period.  Both of these
dates may be in the future.
3.1.1.1.3.133.2.1.1.3.10 Buyer’s Remorse
Buyer’s remorse option  can be exercised by the customer if they are not satisfied with the wireless service
or with  the device they have taken on instalments and/or trade up plan.
This feature provides functionality  for the customer to be able to cancel the service, and/or handset
instalment plan including TradeUps within a predefined ‘buyer’s remorse’ number of days.
Upon exercising this option, the customer is required to return the device (if applicable), and the solution
will reverse all charges the customer incurred with  the service.  The service will be cancelled and
deprovisioned  on the network for service Buyer’s Remorse.
3.1.1.1.3.143.2.1.1.3.11 Notifications Features
3.1.1.1.3.14.13.2.1.1.3.11.1 Threshold Monitoring
Threshold monitoring  generates customer alerts when a customer allowance is associated with a market
offer or bundle:
• Reaches a specified percentage of the allowance.
• It is due to expire.
• Expires.
The percentages and associated alerts are determined from reference data tables.
3.1.1.23.2.1.2 PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT
Encompass Product  Lifecycle Management (PLM) offers customers the ability to implement product  centric
process flows that align with  TM Forum best practices.
Encompass PLM is aligned with TM Forum specifications and provides a starting point  for product
catalogue implementations.
With PLM, Freedom can:

• Adopt a standard structure, terminology  and classification scheme for business processes to
simplify internal operations and maximize opportunities.
• Apply disciplined and consistent business processes enterprise wide.
• Understand, design, develop and manage product  offers in terms of business process
requirements so they better meet business needs.
• Create consistent and high-quality  end-to-end  process flows, eliminating  gaps and
duplications  in product centric process flows.
3.1.1.33.2.1.3 BUSINESS  AND ADMINISTRATION  STUDIO
Business and Administration Studio  is a web-based tool for creating and maintaining  go-to market
offerings and any associated offer pricing or product related reference data. Offers can be created from
reusable components  using drag and drop to add components to existing offers as well as very quickly
bringing new offers to market.
Business and Administration Studio  uses guided processes and business language,  allowing non-technical
users including  marketing teams to easily create and modify offers to their customers.
The tool uses the term ‘Market Offer’ for the top-level package or plan that you sell to a customer. The
difference between one Market Offer and another could be very small, making it important  to reuse as
much product  catalogue inventory  as possible e.g. the price and included  data volume GB, with all other
pieces being the same or one offer includes multi-play  services and others are single services offers.
These pieces in Encompass are the underlying  components  to pick and choose in putting  a Market Offer
together.  In some cases, it could be cloning  an existing offer and making  the modification,  or in others
making the new choice part of the existing offer that the customer or user selects as part of the order
process.

• The Offer Type – a combination  of the types of services, equipment, tariffs and pricing rules to
be used for the offer.
• Bundles – which Bundles to include in the offer.  A Bundle is how a hierarchy of offerings is
supported,  with reuse across different Market Offers.
• Features – the required components of the Bundle/ Market Offer. Examples of Features
include:
o An entitlement  for included  usage like 500 minutes of local calls, or 10GB of data
o A promotion  that gives a discount  for 3 months,  or double  data allowance for 6 months
o An optional  insurance product
o Optional  international  roaming
The following  screenshots illustrate the look and feel of this web-based tool,  when browsing  Market Offers
and Bundles (see Figure 6Figure 6 and Figure 7Figure 7) and visualizing the structure of a Market Offer
(see Figure 8Figure 8).

3.1.1.73.2.1.7 MANAGE  TABLES & REFERENCE DATA
Business and Administration Studio  allows Business users to manage the reference data. This includes
managing  rates, invoice texts, GL data, notifications,  thresholds, etc.  Special Promotions  limited in time
can be managed by creating a limited date ranged version of a specific rate table (Offer DA Table). If the
promotion  is permanent,  an End Date is not required on the new version. Managing reference data can be
done directly on “Business & Administration Studio” or via the import and export functionality.

FIGURE 11:  B&A STUDIO – MANAGING  REFERENCE  DATA

3.1.1.83.2.1.8 AVAILABILITY  POLICY
Limited time offers, limited stocks or new features that will soon become available, are part of the
availability policy structure within Encompass. Encompass manages limited time offers, and date ranged
offers using date ranged Product  Catalogue entities. Stock limitations require integration into external
inventory solutions such as ‘homes passed’.

FIGURE 12: B&A STUDIO – OFFER  AVAILABILITY

To enable Marketing departments  to control  when and for how long offers are available, Encompass
provides date range capability on all Product  Catalogue entities:
• Offering definitions
• Product  definitions
• Service definitions
• Equipment  definitions
These date ranges are transferred to the Agent as controls on when provisioning  may start, and when
provisioning  is no longer possible. An Agent will be unable to provision a product,  offering, service, or
equipment  if their current time is outside the applicable date settings.
The granularity of date ranging  is a system wide constraint,  either day granularity, by date, or sub-day
granularity,  date and time. In the latter case most service providers set entities date ranges to midnight,
e.g. 01/01/2014 00:00:00.
3.23.3 CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT
3.2.13.3.1 CUSTOMER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Encompass is customer centric, whereas legacy billing  systems have been mostly account centric. A
customer is the billable entity in Encompass and is often referred to as a customer node. A customer node,
with its unique ID, can have multiple accounts.
Each customer can also have multiple  products with  the accompanying  services and equipment  associated
with it. These are defined in the Encompass Product Catalogue and linked  to the customer when an order
is completed. Multiple  products and services instance are assigned to the customer, and the respective
charges are applied to the customer’s accounts. Each customer ID is linked to one or several payment
methods, invoice formats and customer queries or cases.

Encompass makes it possible to define and work  with an account structure hierarchy, known  as a
customer hierarchy.  Customer hierarchies identify customer nodes that are used to represent each
primary account for a specific billing/reporting  point.
Typically, a customer hierarchy will mirror a customer’s organizational structure.  There is no limit to the
number of levels (or depth) that the service provider can define for a customer hierarchy as shown nor
how wide the hierarchy is.
There are production  implementations  of Encompass efficiently supporting  hierarchies involving  millions
of nodes, enabling  the very largest Enterprise organizations to be managed as a single customer and be
charged and billed in line with  their preferences.
Encompass Customer Connect module is an integral part of Encompass, shares the same database and
business rules as Encompass Convergent Billing  (Rating, Charging, Billing and Product Catalogue) and
therefore provides a 360° view of a customers’ history and outlines what have been their services, active
services today, services already inquired upon  or quoted  or to be proposed.
Encompass Customer Connect is a web-client user interface that provides a streamlined customer
experience without  the expensive integration  and deployment  risks normally associated with  CRM and
billing integration. Encompass Customer Connect is designed to capture every customer interaction,
providing  a holistic view of the customer via a Web-based customer service representative (Agent) client.
Customer interactions or queries are managed by an integrated  Case Management module with TMF
compliant business processes for amongst other orders, bill inquires, payments, disputes,  customer
problem handling  and treatments.
Encompass supports a time zone for customer data, where a Customer Service Representatives (Agents)
can view date-time information  of customer related entities in the customer’s time zone. This can easily be
automated to support  customers that deploy Encompass in multiple countries and require their time data
to be presented consistently and aligned with the location.
An entity can be associated with a time zone such that all date-time values for that entity are treated as
being in that time zone.

Time zone support  is available for contacts and customers. It extends to the following:
• A list of available time zones can be configured.
• A time zone may be associated with an entity.  Once a time zone is set, date-time values for
the entity refer to the entity’s time zone.
• Date-time values may be configured  to be stored in the server time zone.
• The entity’s time zone is considered when  performing a search as at a particular date.
• Encompass Customer Connect provides a configurable offset to support searching for entities
associated with a time zone.
3.2.1.13.3.1.1 CUSTOMER MODEL
This section will describe the proposed solution’s customer model. The section is structured as follows:
• A general overview of the entities used in the customer model.
• A description of the customer hierarchy supported  by customer model.
• The specifics of the entities used in the proposed solution’s customer model.
3.2.1.23.3.1.2 GENERAL  OVERVIEW  OF THE CUSTOMER MODEL
ENTITIES
The proposed solution  provides the following  set of entities to model a customer:
• Contact
The contact represents the person who acts on behalf of the customer. More than one
contact can be associated with a customer. This is useful for corporate customers where more
than one person is likely to be contacted. If more than one contact is associated with a
customer, one contact must be nominated  as the primary contact with the others being
secondary contacts.
The contact entity consists of several data attributes, a contact type and contact name.
• Customer
A customer is a person or organization  that uses, or intends to use, one of your company’s
products.  Further, the customer represents the legal entity to which an invoice will be issued
or a virtual entity for which reporting  or billing  details will be available. A customer may be
referred to as a customer node.
The customer entity consists of several data attributes including  a customer type and
customer name.
• Account
When a customer is created in Encompass, an account is automatically created for that
customer. This account is the customer’s primary account and is typically the account to which
all invoiced amounts,  payments, and adjustments  are posted. Additional  accounts can also be
configured.  These additional accounts are referred to as secondary accounts. For example, a
customer may have a primary postpaid  account and a secondary prepaid account.
The account entity consists of several data attributes including an account type and account
number.
• Address
The customer and contact entities in the customer model can be associated with addresses.
Each contact can have up to three addresses: home, work and postal address. Each customer
can have up to three addresses. For further information,  please see section 3.3.1.4.43.2.1.4.4.
These entities are shown in the following  diagram.

FIGURE 14:  CONTACT, CUSTOMER  AND ACCOUNT  MODEL
3.2.1.33.3.1.3 DESCRIPTION  OF THE SUPPORTED  CUSTOMER
HIERARCHIES
The proposed solution  allows customers to be either a standalone customer or part of a customer
hierarchy. A customer can have zero or one parent customer. In addition,  a customer can have zero to
many child customers. If a customer has no parent customer and no child customers, then they are a
standalone customer. Otherwise, they are part of a customer hierarchy.
An illustrative example of a hierarchical customer structure is shown  in Figure 15: Example of a Customer
HierarchyFigure 15: Example of a Customer Hierarchy.
Typically, a customer hierarchy will mirror a corporate customer’s organizational structure. The number of
individual  nodes in a hierarchy is limited only by hardware resources. There are production
implementations  of Encompass efficiently supporting  hierarchies involving  millions of nodes, enabling the
very largest corporate customer bases to be addressed.

FIGURE 15:  EXAMPLE  OF A CUSTOMER  HIERARCHY

In summary, complex customer hierarchies can be easily and flexibly  modeled within Encompass, with
products and service offerings supported  at all levels in the customer hierarchy. Hierarchies can also be
used to represent reporting  or aggregation  nodes.
3.2.1.43.3.1.4 PROPOSED SOLUTION’S CUSTOMER MODEL
The proposed solution’s customer model supports a customer who can use both prepaid and postpaid
services while maintaining  two separate accounts:
• A postpaid primary account, for charges that are to be settled in a post-pay manner.
• A prepaid secondary account.
This customer model includes services that are authorized and charged to any account in a hierarchy (i.e.
an affiliate account), and services that operate in both prepaid and postpaid mode (i.e. hybrid  services).
The customer model is also configured  with  a defined set of customer, contact and account types to
support  this model. The specifics of the configured  customer, contacts and accounts are described in the
following  subsections.

The customer model is also configured  with  a defined set of customers, contact and account types to
support  this model. The specifics of the configured  customer, contacts and accounts are described in the
following  subsections.
3.2.1.4.13.3.1.4.1 CONTACTS
When a contact is created, it must be assigned one and only one contact type.

 The following  standard contact types are supported by Encompass. The contact type determines which
attributes are relevant and required for a contact of that type:
1. Anonymous (Unregistered): a limited number of attributes are required when creating this type.
Its purpose is to enable contacts to be created with minimal touch,  meaning no personally
identifiable information  is required. This type is used when pre-loading contacts into the system in
batches for streamlined order entry (e.g. simple prepaid activations) and is later changed to
Named when  an actual person is onboarded by the Service Provider.
2. Named (Consumer/Business): this type is used when  an actual person is created with personally
identifiable information.  Rule 1 specifies the standard mandatory attributes however some
jurisdictions  require additional  attributes to be captured. For example, national identity  number
(e.g. driver’s license number, social security number, passport/visa number), capturing consent to
satisfy GDPR regulations, capturing  email address for One Time Pin validations.
3. Internal: this is a platform-specific contact type used for unidentified  payments and roaming
partner customers.
TABLE 2: CONTACT MODEL RULES
# Rule Example
1 The following  contact attributes are
mandatory:
• Name
• Contact Type
• Contact Status
• Min 1 address
• Min 1 phone number
For Anonymous and Internal contact
types, dummy values are used as
defaults to satisfy this rule.
Name: Mary Black
Contact Type: Consumer
Contact Status: Subscriber
Billing Address: 123 East Street, AB, T4X 1L7
Phone: 0562 224 558

The standard functionality  of CSG Encompass will be delivered with  the following  extensions and
restrictions:
• Various contact types to support Freedom’s current business.
• Additional set of contact attributes to support Freedom’s current business.
• Extend the APIs to create/update contacts to include  the new attributes.
3.2.1.4.23.3.1.4.2 CUSTOMERS
The following  standard customer types are supported  in Encompass. The customer type determines which
attributes are relevant and required for a customer of that type. The following  are included:

• Business: intended  for business consumers
• Unidentified  Payments: an internal type used to store unidentified  payments that cannot be
immediately guided  to a customer
Some of the key information  associated with a customer is:
• The parent customer (if this is a hierarchy)
• The primary contact (TMF’s Customer’s Engaged Party)
• The Reporting Level (for standalone customers this defaults to invoice however in hierarchies,
invoices, statements and no reporting applies)
• Postal address for invoices/documents
• Bill cycle (when periodic billing  occurs, e.g. 5
th
 of the month)
• Credit rating/score (e.g. low/medium/high  risk)
• Credit Limit (this is a CSP-defined monetary figure typically mapped from the credit rating
values)
• Payment details
• Company details (if Business customer type)
The information  mastered with  the Encompass customer relates to billing  and credit management. It is
not intended  to contain personal information  that is unrelated to the billing function.  The contact entity is
intended  for that purpose.
The standard functionality  of CSG Encompass will be delivered with  the following  extensions and
restrictions:
• Additional customer types to support Freedom’s current business.
• Addition of customer attributes that will support Freedom’s current business.
• Extend the APIs to create/update customers to include the new attributes.
3.2.1.4.33.3.1.4.3 CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS
The solution  provides the following  account types:
• Postpaid Debtor
• Prepaid
All customers have a primary account of type Postpaid Debtor.
When anonymous  prepaid customers are created, they will have a secondary prepaid account created by
default.
Registered prepaid customers all start as anonymous  prepaid customers prior to registering their details
and so they also have a secondary prepaid account.
For residential customers, prepaid accounts are added when  a Prepaid or Hybrid product  is sold to the
customer node, and no prepaid account already exists. If a prepaid account already exists and the new
prepaid service does not require a dedicated account, there is no need to create a new prepaid account
when the new prepaid service is sold.
3.2.1.4.43.3.1.4.4 CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS
A customer has one or more accounts. The purpose  of an account is to track all the charges, payments and
adjustments that the customer is responsible for.

An account can be an asset account or a liability account. Asset accounts are used to track money owed to
the Service Provider by a customer or by a partner.
A liability account is used to track money owed by the Service Provider to a customer or a third party (e.g.
shares of revenue owed to partners, taxes levied on services that are owed to the revenue commissioners,
consumer prepaid amounts for which  the Service Provider is obliged  to provide  service.
The following  standard account types are supported  in Encompass:
1. (Mandatory Primary) Debtor: this is an asset account to track all monies owed to the Service
Provider. Every Encompass customer, regardless of the types or postpaid/prepaid  products
purchased, has a debtor account as its primary account.
2. Secondary Deposit: this is a liability account used to track money a Service Provider owes to a
customer. When services are sold that require a deposit to be collected, the deposit is stored
in this account. Multiple  deposit accounts can be created if the Service Provider has a need to
separately manage individual  deposits.
3. Secondary Prepaid: this is a liability account used to track the money paid by a customer to
which the Service Provider has a responsibility  to provide service.
Every Encompass customer, be they standalone or participating  in a hierarchy, must have a primary
account.  Secondary accounts are optional
TABLE 3: CUSTOMER MODEL RULES
# Rule Example
1 A customer can only have 1 primary
account that is invoiced. Therefore,
Encompass does not  support having
multiple  primary accounts of the same
type.
See diagram below showing  a single primary account
and multiple secondary accounts
2 There can be multiple  secondary
accounts. By default, statements are
generated for secondary accounts.
See diagram below showing  multiple secondary
accounts.

The customer entity can have 1 to 3 addresses (postal address, home and work address), the contact entity
can have up to 1 to 2 addresses (e.g. postal address) and the individual  services can have 0 to 1 address
(where the specific service is located or installed)
3.2.1.53.3.1.5 CREDIT CLASS  AND CREDIT LIMIT ASSIGNMENT
Credit limit and credit class are set at the customer level. Encompass will derive the customer’s credit limit
based on the customer credit class and the customer type. This can be overwritten  by the Agent.
3.2.1.5.13.3.1.5.1 CUSTOMER CREDIT MANAGEMENT
This section covers management of the customer’s credit class and details captured for the purposes of
establishing the customer’s credit class.
There are two parts to the solution  for Freedom:
• A connection to an external credit profiling  agency, to deliver customer information.
• Credit authorization to determine if the customer’s credit profile will allow the purchase of
selected products.
These features presume credit checking is required for all product purchases without  exception.
3.2.1.5.1.13.3.1.5.1.1 Credit Check Interface
Encompass can use an external credit profiling  agency for customer credit checks. Encompass will supply
customer details to the agency across the interface. In return Encompass expects a single code to be
returned along with  short text that is meaningful  to the Agent.
The information  that Encompass will supply is one or more of the following customer identifiers:
• Full name or Company name.
• Customer’s address details, for up to 3 addresses.
• Customer’s date of birth.
• Credit Card information,  driver’s license, national identity number, tax file number, corporate
tax number, company number.
Encompass will map the supplied agency code to a customer credit class code. The customer credit class
code can then be used by Encompass to drive business logic, as described in section 3.3.1.5.1.23.2.1.5.1.2.
Encompass will store the returned agency code, reason text and derived credit class code for each request
for historical purposes. Only the latest credit class code derived is used by Encompass for driving  business
logic.
Encompass will integrate with Sonic, potentially  leveraging the previously implemented  integration.
3.2.1.5.1.23.3.1.5.1.2 Credit Scoring
Encompass allows Freedom to manage which  products are available to be ordered by a customer, based
on an operator-maintained  reference table that maps:
• The customer type, and
• The product  offering
to the minimum  credit class allowable.

Page 47 of 169

Encompass will use this reference table to filter the product catalogue based on the customer’s credit
class. If the customer does not meet the required credit class for a specific product option,  then it will not
be displayed on the Agent’s screen.
3.2.1.63.3.1.6 DEFAULT BILL  CYCLE ASSIGNMENT
For a new customer entity, the bill cycle will be inherited  from the parent node (if within  a hierarchy) or will
be assigned a default bill cycle using a customizable algorithm.  The details of the algorithm  will be driven
from the following customer attributes:
• Customer Type
• Offer
• Day of month  the Account is created
The Bill Cycle may be overridden by an Agent or API.

FIGURE 17: DEFAULT BILL  CYCLE  ASSIGNMENT  CONFIGURATION

3.2.1.73.3.1.7 BULK CUSTOMER CREATION AND UPDATE
CSG Encompass will provide a batch interface that allows bulk  loading of customers. This is expected to be
used by Freedom to on-board small batches of customers.
The customer details are provided in CSV, ASCII formatted files. CSG Encompass sequentially processes the
customer details and implements row level validation on the entries in the file. The bulk  customer load
does not support  future-dated  or back-dated customer creation.
The following  scenarios are covered as part of the solution  proposal.

3.2.1.83.3.1.8 CUSTOMER LIFECYCLE
3.2.1.8.13.3.1.8.1 PREPAID CUSTOMERS
The customer lifecycle allows different life cycle states (periods) of a prepaid or hybrid customer to be
distinguished.  Based on the prepaid service status different handling or activities can be allowed or
restricted. Only  one status is active at a time.
The lifecycle status of the prepaid service can change either as a result of some activity in the service (top
up takes a subscriber from the grace period) or as a result of elapsed time. For every status change the
resulting new status is defined within  the lifecycle, including  activities like recalculation of expiration  dates,
information  towards the customer and triggering  processing logic.

widely used statuses are:
• prospect,
• active,
• black-listed,
• cancellation required,
• cancelled and
• credit check required
Other statuses can be configured,  if required.
The lifecycle status of customers can change as a result of business rules such as:
• Black-listing a customer after a debt write-off
• Activating a customer after a successful credit check
• Moving a customer from prospect to active

FIGURE 18: CUSTOMER –CONNECT - 60 SECOND  VIEW

Customer Connect screens have been designed around the Agent’s workflow. They assist the Agent in
navigating  through dialogue with  the customer, and present relevant information  at each point. The next
section provides an outline of the key Customer Connect screens.
Customer Connect provides the following  CRM Main Menu capability:
• Manage Contact   • Payment Enquiry
• Manage Customer  • Promise To Pay
• Sales Order  • Account Adjustment
• Change Of Ownership • Trouble Shooting
• Balance Enquiry  • Customer Service
• New Payment • Payment Enquiry
3.2.23.3.2 CASE MANAGEMENT
Encompass offers a comprehensive case management capability, allowing all aspects of customer’s
interaction with Freedom to be captured.  All case information is recorded against the relevant customer
and can be accessed subsequently in the future. This data is captured via three main objects:
• Cases
• Issues
• Actions
An association of these objects is depicted in the figure below.

Page 51 of 169

FIGURE 19: CASES,  ISSUES  AND ACTIONS  ASSOCIATIONS

A case is created when a customer communicates with Freedom and represents a single interaction with
that customer. A case records the details of the interaction, which  may include several different requests
the customer may make, including  sales orders, payments, or enquiries raised. These requests are
referred to as issues and are specific to the type of request they handle. A case is not considered resolved
until all issues in the case are resolved.
Most of the time the user can resolve the customer’s request immediately, but some requests may require
tasks to be completed by other parts of the organization. Encompass captures these tasks as actions,
which can be arranged into sequential or parallel flows. Actions are the individual  steps in these flows and
Encompass allows the history of actions performed for a customer to be captured.
Most actions are created automatically by the system in response to actions taken by the user, however in
some cases the user can manually request an action be queued.
The following  manual actions are provided:
• Follow  Up Call – When user want  to enter an action to call the customer back in response to
some question  that they may have asked.
• Follow  Up Adjustment – When investigation  is required to determine if adjustment  credit
should be given to the customer e.g. customer complains about poor service quality and
threatens to cancel the service, as an incentive the user may offer credit adjustment but may
want to look into customer’s credit history to decide.

Page 52 of 169

Actions are automatically assigned to an individual  or a work group and have a target duration which
determines the due date for completion.  The target duration  can consider a working  day calendar e.g.
complete within  five business days. A user can then take the next pending  action off their own personal
action queue, or the queues for any work  groups they are a member of, to progress the action to
completion.
Notification,  via on screen alerts or emails, can be configured  to remind users to complete outstanding
actions or warn managers of potential  due date breaches, and escalation paths can be configured  to reassign actions when teams cannot service the action in time.

FIGURE 20:  CUSTOMER CONNECT - CASE  MANAGEMENT
Case Management enables the managing  of queries/complaints raised by customers from the various
communication  channels that are supported via the proposed integration.
The Case Management functionality  provides the framework for:
• All communications  and activities made on behalf of customers to be captured using a
combination  of a case, issues and actions.
• A case records the details of a single customer interaction,  which may include  a number of
different items including  sales orders and customer inquiries.   These items are known as
issues. Follow-up  interactions are managed as additional  items to the original  case.
• Actions may be carried out to resolve a customer’s issue.
Customer Connect provides a comprehensive search capability, for example.

customer queries.
• Global search is used to identify  the contact or customer and open their overview.
• Agents can open information  about Cases, Products, Orders or Billing.
• Global search also allows the Agent to query from the Case or Order.
• The Case records all interactions with the customer at all stages.
• The Customer Summary screen provides a full set of information  about  the customer and
their services to support in the handling  of a query.

Problem to Resolution
Customer Connect allows Agent to associate a Troubleshooting  Issue to be associated with a Case. When
raised, the Agent can lodge a range of types of problem,  record details from the customer about the
nature of the problem and record how the customer wishes to be notified/updated  as the problem is
progressed.
Agent can associate the following  types of Customer Service request with  a Case.
• Billing Enquiry
• Dispute
• Account Adjustment
Customer Connect guides the Agent through  handling  these Cases.
All Cases are managed through to completion  with each step recorded.
Cases may involve multiple Issues, which  may have multiple activities associated with them and customer
communications  associated with them.
At a higher level, Customer Connect presents a view of the history of interaction, including  Cases, with a
specific customer. This allows the Agent to gauge whether this specific Case and interaction is related to a
wider problem and also set the “tone” for the conversation based on the number and type of Cases raised.
3.2.2.13.3.2.1 CASE ISSUES
Encompass Customer Connect provides the ability to search for a customer based on defined search
criteria, once the customer is successfully returned then the Agent can log the interaction as an Issue
when they trigger one of the following  operations:
• Manage Contact
• Manage Customer
• Sales Order
• Change Of Ownership
• Balance Enquiry
• New Payment
• Payment Enquiry
• Promise To Pay
• Account Adjustment
• Trouble Shooting
• Customer Service
• Compose Email
A case is always associated with a customer account,  a customer account can have multiple  open/closed
cases associated.
An attribute  on the case will identify  the source of the Case, this could be Call Centre, Store, system
generated via a Treatment etc.
The Agent will attempt to resolve the customer enquiry immediately but if they cannot then they may have
to hand off the enquiry to another representative, this can be achieved by creating an Action.

3.2.2.2.13.3.2.2.1 ACTION OVERRIDE
When creating the set of Action Types, Encompass will initially supply  default action type attributes values,
(e.g., Action Duration,  Work Group etc.) but over time the Service Provider may wish to override these
values following  its own internal team reorganizations or output  of action reporting.  Therefore,
Encompass will provide the Service Provider with client-maintained  reference data tables to support  the
overriding  of the default action attributes  per action type. Upon action instance creation, Encompass will
look up this table and utilize the override values if defined

3.2.2.33.3.2.3 WORKGROUP  CALENDAR
CSG Encompass provides a Calendar which can be associated to the action type and defines the working
hours–Monday - Sunday. The calendar will also include the list of statutory  and company holidays. This
reference data can be set up by Freedom.

3.2.33.3.3 CUSTOMER  ORDER MANAGEMENT
Order management is a critical activity for a service provider. Orders must be entered accurately and
frequently  require a great amount  of detail from the customer. Orders must also be entered quickly to
increase efficiency and customer satisfaction. In addition,  the Agent may need guidance in recommending
a product that best meets the ’customer’s needs.
Encompass plays a primary role in the activities involved  in accepting customer orders and issuing service
orders; and tracking the various distributed  orders until completed.
Customer Connect provides order entry screen and functionality  that enables an Agent to create and
inquire on orders through  a single screen and captures any type of customer product or offer-related
request. This avoids the need for complex and time-consuming  navigation and reduces Agent training
time.
3.2.3.13.3.3.1 ORDER ESTABLISHMENT
The sections below describe order management activities supported  by Encompass.
3.2.3.1.13.3.3.1.1 PRODUCT CATALOGUE MANAGEMENT
It is assumed that the Market Offers, Product Offers and Inventory  are configured and set up in the
Encompass product catalogue via Business & Administration  Studio and to be consumed by the order
establishment process in Customer Connect.
3.2.3.1.23.3.3.1.2 CUSTOMER ORDER ESTABLISHMENT
Customer Connect guides the Agent through  the ordering  process:
• Presenting recommendations  of Offers, Bundles and Promotions  which have been selected
based on the customer’s profile, channel, sales market and stores.
• Allowing  the Agent to filter through  product  features and options to identify  the right  product
for the customer.
• Guiding  the Agent through  gathering  all necessary information (including  device details) to
allow the order to be provisioned.
• Reviewing any one-off, up-front  of recurring pricing information,  with the privileged Agent
being given authority  to offer concessions and discounts (negotiation).
• Placing multiple orders into a Cart for activation.
• Mobile number portability.
• Hand-off to activation processes.
• Altering and Updating an Order.
OFFER SELECTION AND AVAILABILITY
The Sales Order process begins with  the Offers screen where the Agent is presented with all available
Market Offers and Product  Offers. Each Market Offer is displayed as an “Offer Card” with summary details
provided i.e. offer name, description, usage rates and charges. A detailed view is also available with
information  on contract options, allowances, pricing, free apps, devices and event rates.

For viewing purpose, market offers are grouped into different catalogues and within  each catalogue offers
are grouped into  different categories. The default catalogues provided  by Customer Connect are
Promotion  Offers and Recommended Offers. The purpose of these catalogues is to present the current
promotion  offers or recommended offers to the Agent.

FIGURE 23: VIEW OF  OFFERS  RELEVANT  TO A SPECIFIC  CUSTOMER

Within  each catalogue, only available offers for the customer are displayed. This allows the Agent to
discuss the available market offers options  with the customer. Offer availability is defined based on rules
defined by Business.
Searching and filtering capabilities are available in each catalogue for the Agent to locate the market offers
the Customer may be interested in. The filtering  can be applied across the entire catalogue or within
individual  category of a catalogue.

Special promotional  offers can be tied to a one-time promotion code. Customers with  a valid promotion
code can purchase a special market offer via the promotion redemption  process. Customer Connect
provides a screen for the Agent to enter promotion code and performs validation.  Upon successful
validation market offers associated with the promotion code will be presented on screen available for
purchase.
promotion validation  logic is API based and is configurable  by implementation  teams. The available
market offers associated with a promotion code are also configurable by implementation  teams.
OFFER CONFIGURATION
When the desired market offer/s have been agreed with the customer, the Agent can proceed to the Offer
Configuration  screen to start an Order. The configuration  screen is where bundles  can be selected and
added to the order. Mandatory bundles are automatically added to the order, and optional  bundles can be
added by the Agent.
Bundles available are based on the selected Market Offer or Freedom specific business rules ensuring
valid orders are formed. Freedom specific business rules are defined by implementation  teams and can be
configured  in Customer Connect by extending  the APIs supplied.
Bundles are grouped into one of the following  types: Addons, VAS, Deposit, Discount and Devices. Within
each type, all available bundles are displayed in a flat structure with  search and filtering mechanism
provided.
In situations where direct fulfillment  orders are allowed and necessary, agents have the ability to record
the customer's delivery address during  the ordering  process.
Tab and TradeUp functionalities are addressed in 3.2.1.1.3.33.1.1.1.3.3.

MOBILE NUMBER SELECTION
Resources such as Mobile Number (MSISDN) are allocated during offer configuration.  Customer Connect
supports the following  different number  allocation methods:
• Reserved Number
o A previously reserved number for the customer can be retrieved and assigned.
• Select Number
o Agent can search for an available number from inventory.  A number pool and category
can be specified when searching for a number.
o A number combination  search is also provided to look for specific number patterns.
• Vanity Number
o As part of marketing, Service Providers may have vanity numbers on offer. A vanity
number is a premium number  that contains custom digits  that are easy to remember or
spell. The Market Offer can be configured  with  a vanity number category, e.g. Silver and
Customer Connect will default the category on Select Number method  to the configured
category.
o In addition,  bundles can be configured  allowing  the Customer to add vanity number is an
additional  option.  When an additional  vanity bundle is selected, the Select Number
method  will default the category accordingly.  For example, if the Customer wishes to
have a mobile number from the platinum category, the Agent will add the platinum
vanity number bundle  which will default the Select Number category to platinum.
• Port Number
o Mobile number porting  request is captured as part of Offer Configuration.  The MSISDN
to port and Current Operator fields are required to be populated.  A Temporary MSISDN
is assigned if required.
o The Port Number method is configurable,  for Service Providers not offering number
porting  this method can be omitted from the Customer Connect UI.
o The use of temporary number  is based on Encompass configuration  setup. If a
temporary number is not required as part of the porting  process this can be disabled via
the configuration.

When a subscription is no longer required by the Customer, a cancel subscription request is initiated.
During the process, a retention option  is provided to entice the customer to maintain  their subscription.
Retention Market Offers and bundles will be displayed to attract the customer with the hope to retain their
service. If the customer chooses a new Market Offer, a change plan is performed. If the customer chooses
to add a retention  bundle, the bundle  is added to their existing subscription.  The retention  Market Offers,
and bundles are configurable by implementation  teams.
If the customer declines the retention  option  provided, the subscription  will be cancelled. The cancellation
may trigger cancellation charges to be applied. The charges are returned by the AoC and depending  on
the configuration  the cancellation charges may be negotiable.
3.2.3.1.43.3.3.1.4 PRE/POSTPAID CONVERSION
An Agent can migrate a customer between prepaid and postpaid offers.
For prepaid to postpaid conversion, the unused prepaid balance will be transferred to the postpaid
account with this order. Upon checkout, Prepaid balance can also be used to pay for the order.
In such a case, the remaining prepaid balance will be transferred to the postpaid account once
the migration order is submitted.
• For postpaid to prepaid conversion, upon selecting the Postpaid to Prepaid button  in Customer
Connect, the  postpaid  offer will  be cancelled with  a specific cancelation reason to  be selected
by the Agent, and customer will pay any outstanding  amount and move to a new prepaid offer.
• Notification  is sent to the customer.
3.2.3.1.53.3.3.1.5 PROMOTIONS
The current Freedom solution supports a custom promotions  engine. The primary function  of the
promotion  engine is to automate the application of various rules and conditions  to determine and deliver
promotional  offers to customers. It supports different  types of promotions,  such as amount or percentage
discounts,  and can tailor these promotions  based on usage frequency, customer segments, or product
levels. Promotions  can be automatic or manual, enhancing customer engagement and driving sales by
providing  relevant and timely offers.
The following  use cases are currently supported  by the existing solution.  The specific use cases to be
supported  will be identified during  the project's definition  phase. The scope of support  will be limited to
the use cases that are actively exercised in production.
Bulk Promo Activation for Customer Accounts: This use case involves a business-triggered campaign
where customers receive SMS notifications about promotions  and can respond to activate them. The
operations team receives lists of interested customers and applies the promotions  accordingly, either
automatically or requiring  customer action.
Auto Promotion Check for Adding New Service to New or Existing Accounts: This use case checks for
any automatic promo  eligibility that can be applied to new services and at the account level when  a new
service is added to either a new or existing  account.
Auto Promo Check Upon Tab Info Change + Hardware Upgrade: This use case ensures the integrity  of
the promotions associated with a service upon any change in the Tab info. It checks for any automatic
promo eligibility  that can be applied to the service.
Auto Promo Check upon Rate Plan Change: For any service update action, if the old service rate plan is
different from the new rate plan, this use case checks for any auto promo eligibility  that can be applied to
the new service and at the account level.
Auto Promo Check Upon Addon Addition: This use case checks for any automatic promo eligibility  that
can be applied to the service upon activation of a specific addon.
Auto Promo Check upon Addon Cancellation: This use case disables any promo that is attached to the
addon to be cancelled.

Manual Promo Addition: Promos can be added manually through Customer Connect or through
Channels (API Request) in various scenarios such as addon addition, new service (Sales Order), connection
fee application, and hardware upgrade.
Auto Promo Check Upon Hardware  Upgrade: This use case checks for any automatic promo eligibility
that can be applied to the service upon hardware upgrade.
Auto Promo Check Upon Handset Change: This use case checks for any automatic promo  eligibility that
can be applied to the service level in case of any change in the Handset (IMEI /SKU) and any service
update.

3.2.3.1.63.3.3.1.6 MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
 The Encompass solution  will leverage where possible MNP functionality  from the existing Singleview
implementation Establishing an order may include  carrying out Mobile Number Portability  (MNP) adhering
to the processes governed by local authority.  This enables customers to retain their mobile number when
switching  providers. Encompass fully supports both  port-in and port-out  scenarios, ensuring seamless
number portability.
Syniverse, acting as the MNP Gateway, manages the Local Number Portability  (LNP), which is the
framework that allows customers to switch service providers without  changing  their phone  numbers.
Encompass will interface with Syniverse to facilitate the submission and reception of porting  requests
from/to Syniverse, ensuring efficient communication  and streamlined number portability  processes.

Port Activity Tracking: Tracks port requests associated with  services through a unique internal identifier
associated with each port request.
Pre-portability check: Pre-portability  check will be performed against a reference database (e.g. the Local
Exchange Routing Guide, LERG) within the Encompass database. The reference database for the preportability  check will be pre-populated  using data provided by Freedom at a predefined frequency.
A single provisioning  order is created for each Port-Out and Port-In Request. This provisioning  order is
used to trigger outbound  notifications  to external telecommunications  providers through  the portability
gateway. Simple port request will be included as a part of the interface. Simple port involves porting  for a
single line at a time.
Manual intervention  may be required at different times within  the Port-In/Port-Out  lifecycle. Encompass
supports manual updates to port requests. Manual updates are done as part of the order management
process.
3.2.3.1.6.13.3.3.1.6.1 Port-In
A port-in refers to the scenario where a new customer brings their existing number to Freedom’s network.
As part of the order establishment process, Encompass registers the customer’s intent to port their
number,  allowing Customer Service Representatives (Agents) to indicate a port-in request and populate
the necessary details required for the process. Encompass supports  the assignment of a temporary
number to the customer while the port-in is in progress, enabling  service usage. This temporary number
option  is a system-wide feature that can be enabled or disabled based on Freedom’s requirements.
When a subscriber submits a request to move their number  from another provider for a new service
creation Encompass captures and stores the associated port-in request details. Additionally,  Encompass
allows for the modification  of port-in  requests, changes to due dates, cancellations, and the ability to
request messages or notifications from the external system or provider.

3.2.3.1.6.23.3.3.1.6.2 Port-Out
Port-out  processing is required when an existing customer decides to leave Freedom's network  and
transfer their mobile number to another service provider. The Encompass solution expects port-out
requests to be initiated  by an external MNP Gateway (Syniverse) and provides Freedom with the option  to
perform specific validations before permitting  the port-out  request. These default validations include:
• Verify the mobile number exists in the system.
• Verify the associated equipment  is not reported as lost or stolen
• Verify the customer is not blacklisted or in collections.
The solution  captures and stores the details of each port-out  request associated with each service and
additionally  supports retrieving and receiving updates or changes to port-out  requests from other carriers
through  the portability  gateway.
3.2.3.1.6.33.3.3.1.6.3 Giveback Ported in Number
Customers who ported  in their numbers to Freedom from other carriers may choose to cancel their service
for one reason or another.   In these cases, the ported number must be returned back to the original
carrier after a predefined resting period. The new solution  will leverage the existing  Singleview solution
where possible.
Similarly, for those ported-out  numbers that the customer chooses to cancel on other carriers; those
carriers are required to return (snapback) the numbers to Freedom.  The new solution  will leverage
existing Singleview solutions where possible.
Encompass will support  the following  message types, including:
• DSC (Disconnect)SNP (Snapback)
3.2.3.1.73.3.3.1.7 MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY INTERFACE
Encompass provides service calls to interface with the external MNP Gateway (Syniverse) leveraging the
existing Freedom MQ Series implementation.  These services are used to pass details or receive details
from the MNP Gateway to complete a porting  request. For a port-in, Encompass (representing the
recipient service provider) initiates the communication  to the gateway, while a port-out  request is initiated
by the other service provider.

Port In - External Carrier process for Freedom Mobile. This process allows clients to port their existing
MSISDNs (Mobile Station International  Subscriber Directory Numbers) into  the Freedom Mobile network
seamlessly from any other external network carriers. The LNP (Local Number Portability) Port-in process
involves interactions between the recipient network  (Encompass), the gateway mediation (Syniverse), and
the donor network  (external carrier).
The LNP Port-in process supports 3 flows:
1. Normal Port-in processing flow
2. Cancel Port-in process flow
3. Resubmit Port-in process flow

The LNP Port-in functionality  includes features such as:
• Manual launch of the porting  process.

• Steps for creating a new sales order for new customers who want to keep their existing telephone
number.
• Steps for product  maintenance when existing customers want to port  in their telephone number.

Encompass will support  the following  message types, including:
• PQI (Porting Query Initial) - Prepare Initial Port in Request
• ACK (Acknowledgement) – Acknowledgement Response
• PQA (Porting Query Acknowledgement) - PQA response from Syniverse
• PRI (Porting Request Initial) - PRI response from Syniverse
• NOT (Notification) – NOT response from Syniverse

LNP Port-out process, which  is the mirror of the LNP Port-in flow between the recipient network,
mediation,  and donor  network.  Clients can port out their MSISDNs directly via the recipient network carrier
without  notifying  their current providers. The LNP Port-out  process involves interactions between the
Recipient network,  Mediation, and Donor network. Encompass acts as the donor network,  Syniverse as the
gateway mediation, and the external carrier as the recipient network.

LNP Port-out  process support 4 flows:
• Normal Port-out  processing flow
• Port-out cancellation flow
• Port-out Resubmission flow
• Invalid Port-out flow

Encompass will support  the following  message types, including:
• PQ2: Port-out Request to Encompass
• ACK: Acknowledgment
• PR2: Encompass Port-out  Response
• PRA: PRA response
• NOT: Notification response

After receiving the PQ2 message Encompass performs the following:
• Send SMS to customers to confirm the port-out  request
• Bypasses customer Port-out  Confirmation in certain cases
• Updates the Port-out  issue status automatically during  processing

3.2.3.1.83.3.3.1.8 VACATION SUSPENSION – EXISTING PRODUCT MAINTENANCE
Encompass provides the ability to suspend a customer’s active product for a fixed duration to cater for
business scenarios such as reduced recurring charge during  vacation. The Agent must locate the relevant
product  and enter a vacation start date and end date. Encompass will set the product status to ‘Vacation’
and suspend the product  on the specified start date and a reduced recurring charge can be applied if
offered by the Freedom.  On vacation end date, the customer’s product will be reverted to active status
and the original recurring charge will apply only if the product status is ‘Vacation’. For example, if a
customer enters collections and as a result the product is suspended, then on vacation end date,
Encompass will not revert the service to active.
If the customer returns from their vacation early and requests an early reconnect, Encompass provides the
ability for the Agent to trigger the reconnect process.
3.2.3.1.93.3.3.1.9 DEPOSITS
Deposits are monetary amounts requested by a service provider and held on behalf of the customer.
Service providers that allow their customers to use post-pay services have a common problem in
managing  the risk associated with arrears billing.  Deposits are held for a period of time until they are
refunded.
Collecting deposits may provide the service provider with some security in ensuring that the customer
pays their amount owing.  If the customer does not pay their invoiced amount(s), a deposit can be used to
offset the amount  owing.
Encompass provides the functionality  of collecting  a deposit as a part of Order entry.
Collection of deposits and the amounts  to be collected can be configured  to trigger based on the
following.
• Customer type (Business, Residential etc.) and risk profile associated with the customer.
• Purchase of a high value service, product,  and feature.
Deposits can be refunded to a customer manually when the credit class for the customer is upgraded  or
when the customer cancels the product  or service that required deposit.  The deposit can be refunded  as
either a credit to the customer’s main account or as a refund to the customer.
Deposit can be refunded automatically when a deposit maturity  date is reached.
3.2.3.1.103.3.3.1.10 ESIM
Freedom requires the solution to support eSIMs for enabled devices. Encompass will support  the
deployment,  provisioning,  and management of eSIMs through sales outlets at Freedom.
The implementation  will address several areas:
• New Activations: Encompass will support  new activations.
• SIM Swap: Subscribers can swap from a traditional SIM to an eSIM (if supported by the device) or
vice-versa with an optional charge.
• Hardware  Upgrade: Activation of the eSIM will be handled  through  the SIM Swap process. No
charge for eSIM when the subscriber upgrades their hardware to an eSIM capable device.
• QR Code Support: Encompass will provide the QR code information for the generation of the QR
code, Encompass will not  be responsible for generating or displaying a QR code.
• eSIM Suspension/Cancellation: The function will handle eSIM provisioning requests.
• Port In/Port Out: Support for Port In and Port Out functionality.
• Charge for eSIMs: Support the ability to charge (or not charge) for eSIMs.

• Sales Order Process: Support eSIM provisioning  and validate that the subscriber's device is eSIM
capable based on the IMEI before providing  the option  to request or swap to an eSIM.
3.2.3.1.113.3.3.1.11 ESIM WEARABLES
Freedom requires the ability to support  wearable eSIM devices such as an Apple or Samsung Watch. The
new solution  will support  the wearable device as a secondary postpaid service which will be paired to the
primary postpaid phone service. All offers will be identified  as either primary or secondary offer. A primary
offer cannot be activated on a secondary device service, and vice versa. Eligibility will be added to ensure
only secondary wearable offers that are compatible with  the Primary phone offer can be activated.
The secondary device will be activated via APIs from DEG, and its compatibility  with the primary offer will
be ensured. Data entitlements for secondary devices will be configured  similarly to primary devices.
Encompass will support the processing of usage initiated by a wearable device.
The transaction types to be supported for eSIM Wearables are activations, SIM swaps, suspensions, and
cancellations, these will be supported through  APIs.  Activations will be initiated through  DEG to
Encompass.
The new Encompass solution intends to leverage the existing APIs where possible to support  this
integration.
• getRatePlanCompanion: Retrieves available rate plans for a customer's wearable device
• addCompanionSubscriber: Activates the connected device in Encompass.
• changeSIMCompanionSub: Performs a SIM swap for a connected device.
• getInfoCompanionDevices: Retrieves a list of all connected devices for a subscriber.
• subscribeAddon: Adds/provisions an Addon/Feature to a service/phone line.
• retrieveAvailableMSISDN: retrieves available MSISDNs for specified category and pool.
3.2.43.3.4 ORDER TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT
Customer orders use the case management functionality  in Encompass to track the execution  process,
assign workgroups,  notifications  and escalations.
An order is considered completed when  the order is submitted and all downstream  processing (e.g.
Interactivate.) has occurred. Billing is automatically enabled when an order has been completed
3.2.4.13.3.4.1 ORDER DISTRIBUTION
Customer orders are distributed by Encompass after the order is successfully submitted  by the Agent.
Customer orders are decomposed into  the required product  order requests (e.g. bundle decomposition)
and service order requests and, if necessary, distributed CSG Interactivate. This includes the creation of
the appropriate product and component  entities for billing.
Provisioning  operations are triggered to the activation system at appropriate points in the order
management workflow.
3.2.4.1.13.3.4.1.1 PROVISIONING LIFECYCLE
Encompass has a predefined provisioning  lifecycle and a set of associated provisioning  actions. These
represent the general use-case for the lifecycle of products  and components  that need to be provisioned
and billed.
A summary of the lifecycle’s set of success states and request initiation states is displayed in Figure 29.

FIGURE 29: PROVISIONING  LIFECYCLE  (SUCCESS  STATES)

Of note:
• The “Cancellation Required” request state is valid for all states. This is not shown in Figure 29.
• Temporary disconnection  and reconnection are used to indicate voluntary actions on behalf
of the customer, whereas suspension and reactivation are used when the customer enters or
leaves provider-initiated  suspension (e.g. reaching a suspension collection action).
• “Pending Activation” is only used for bundled products where a customer must take some
action to activate their service before it can be used.
• Each transition in Figure 29 also has an associated failure state. This is not shown  in Figure 29.
• Retry transitions from all failure states are derived automatically by the Encompass
provisioning  subsystem. These retry transitions are not shown in Figure 29. These retry
transitions allow for different actions to be performed after a failure state to what would  have
been performed initially.
• Redundant transitions (for example, “Suspension Required” when already suspended) are not
shown in Figure 29 although  are supported for cases where sub-components are suspended
when a parent component  needs to be suspended.

Page 71 of 169

• Additional  transitions to support handling  of collections-related requests that must always be
processed (for example from failure states to Suspension/Reactivation Required) are also
supported.  These are not shown  in Figure 29.
An action code is associated with each provisioning transition request state, for example, the “Activate”
action is associated with the “Activation Required” request state. Implementation of the provisioning
action handlers (e.g. via a call to a provisioning  system) confers meaning to each action.
The capability delivered by Encompass’s provisioning subsystem is both configurable and extensible so it
can be quickly  tailored to support Freedom’s needs as new products and services are delivered. This
includes the addition  of custom states, allowable state transitions  and actions where required.
3.2.4.1.23.3.4.1.2 PROVISIONING
Provisioning  of product/component(s)  involves configuring  them on a network  for use by a customer.
Provisioning  includes actions to set up network  access or network services, change the existing access to
service, or remove access altogether. These processes may involve many systems or network  components.
There are several types of operations that can result in the need to provision services on the network.  In
broad terms, these can be summarized as changes resulting from orders, customer requests and
operations (such as collections).
As illustrated in Figure 30, Encompass’s provisioning  request subsystem:
• Analyzes updates made via orders, customer requests and collections operations to
determine if any provisioning  is required,
• If provisioning is required, determines the required operations, and
Interfaces to the provisioning  system that controls the ultimate setup of the service. The
provisioning  system handles provisioning  of multiple  network elements.

FIGURE 30: PROVISIONING - HIGH-LEVEL  ROLE  OF THE PROVISIONING  REQUEST  SUBSYSTEM

The lifecycle, including  statuses and transitions, of products and components  is central to management  of
provisioning  requests, ensuring the requests made are valid and all systems remain consistent.  State
machines are used to manage the lifecycle of Encompass products  and components.  It is fundamental  that
Encompass is the system of record for the current state for it to be able to operate as the provisioning
request subsystem. Each type of component  can have a different lifecycle; however, subcomponents must
include the parent component  lifecycle as changes at the parent component  are automatically propagated
to child components.

Encompass ensures that the provisioning of service on a network is closely aligned to billing  service
activation by managing the provisioning  requests and state of records within Encompass such that they
align with the state on the network.  This ensures that when a customer can use a service, they are being
billed for it (and vice versa).
Key design features of Encompass’s provisioning solution include the following:

TABLE 6: PROVISIONING – KEY DESIGN FEATURES
DESIGN FEATURE RATIONALE
Key states, state transitions and provisioning
action mappings are defined and can be
configured  as required.
Changes to the status and attributes of
products/components,  collections actions and
equipment  changes automatically trigger
provisioning  as required. Status is maintained  if
a change of ownership  is performed.
Key state transitions  and actions are predefined; new products and services can be
deployed within  the Encompass
provisioning  framework with  speed and
ease.
The state of individual products/components  is
available for viewing,  retrieval and update; and
valid state transitions enforced via restriction to
valid options through  the GUI and validated
through  the API, where applicable.
Valid state transitions are enforced by
Encompass to disallow inconsistent
requests and prevent billing and network
inconsistencies and irregularities.
Disallowing terminal states other than cancelled.
Allows for manual recovery from failure
states.
Allowing the ability to ‘suspend’ a
service/product/component  from any state.
Certain operations (e.g. collections) require
the ability to suspend the service
regardless of the current state.
Exception handling  to avoid services being left in
a provisioning  initiation  state and recovering to
a known  state.
This ensures that valid recovery processes
can be determined  by users when an issue
occurs, such as the timeout  on the
response from the provisioning  system.
This ensures processes can be followed to
ensure the status on the network and
Encompass are aligned, reducing the risk
of revenue leakage, in cases where
services are active on the network  but not
in Encompass.
Customer dissatisfaction, in cases where
services are not active on the network  but
are being billed in Encompass.
Integration  with the Encompass Product
Catalogue to ensure that provisioning  status
changes are propagated to all related entities in
an offer/product  when necessary.
Depending  on the nature of the related
product  and service components,  a
provisioning  success/failure may need to
be propagated  to all related entities. For
example, if the provisioning  of the mobile
phone number  fails then the failure needs

to be propagated to the product,  service
and equipment.
In-built  notification  functionality  that can be
configured  to be invoked on success, failure or
always to notify the operator, raise an
Encompass query or raise an action in
Encompass’s Customer Management module.
Reduction in operational overhead
required to monitor provisioning  issues by
the operator.
In-built  retry functionality  allowing  failed
provisioning  requests to be retried a
configurable  number of times with a
configurable  delay between retries.
Reduction in operational overhead
required to monitor provisioning  issues by
the operator.
Operational monitoring,  support  and auditing  of
provisioning  requests are facilitated.
Provisioning  actions can be monitored,
and the status can be queried, and bulk
retries of failed requests performed by
operational staff through  the GUI.

3.2.4.1.33.3.4.1.3 PROVISIONING INTERFACE
A real-time interface to a provisioning  management system is provided,  conforming  to a published
interface definition. This interface is used to pass details from new or changed orders from Encompass to
the provisioning  system for the purpose of provisioning  customer services on the network  and
provisioning  customer details to other OSS components.
The interface is a request-response system with Encompass always the requesting application and the
provisioning  system the responding  application.  The response message provided by the provisioning
system indicates the success or failure of the provisioning  action(s), that is, Encompass initiates a request
to the provisioning  system, which pushes provisioning  work orders to the network.  The provisioning
system is responsible for error reporting,  commit and rollback where necessary and will respond with
success or failure to Encompass.
The services expected to be available from the provisioning  management system are detailed in Table 7.
The new Encompass solution  will leverage the current integration with  CSG InterActivate to support  the
provision of mobile services.  It is expected that the existing solution  already in place at Freedom can be
reused with  no or limited changes.

TABLE 7: PROVISIONING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SERVICES
SERVICE DESCRIPTION
Provision
Create a service in the network,  assign network  resources and put it into
its initial provisioning  state e.g. first call activation if the first use of the
phone is to force a call to the call center to activate it.
Modify
Used for subsequent  modification  of a service including  adding or
removing features or activating the service after initial provisioning.
Suspend
Provider-enforced suspension of service, for example, for collections or
theft.
Commented [CH15]: Leveraging may be an issue as
there is new integration on the Encompass side we may
want to use rather than leveraging the existing solution.
The correct solution will most likely be to implement ootb,
and Freedom will need to modify the IAT integration on
their side.l

3.2.53.3.5 CUSTOMER  SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOOLBOX
Providing  exceptional customer experience is a key success factor for any service provider and Agents play
a vital role in shaping this customer experience. To handle every customer interaction in a personalized
manner, Agents must have access to tools necessary to deliver an enhanced experience. Encompass
provides optimized tools to address the Agent’s needs to achieve effective and efficient customer
interaction.
3.2.5.13.3.5.1 SAVED SEARCHES
CSG Encompass Case Management handles BSS related issues such as billing enquiry,  disputes and
adjustment,  and is focused on resolving issues raised by customers.
CSG Encompass can be integrated (e.g., when a BSS ticket is created in helpdesk, a ticket is automatically
created in CSG Encompass) with Freedom's existing helpdesk to implement a front-end/Agent case
handling  tool.
CSG Encompass Case Management use Actions, Escalations, Notifications and Workflow  to manage BSS
related tickets.
Processes within Actions, Escalations, Notifications and Workflow  can be manual or automated,  as outlined
below.
Customer Connect provides a comprehensive search capability, for example.

3.2.5.33.3.5.3 CUSTOMER DASHBOARD
Customer Connect Customer Dashboard presents the Customer information  created in Encompass backend. It provides a consolidated  Customer Summary view when a customer is selected. This view provides
the following information “at a glance”: Products and services consumed, Last Transactions, Billing
information,  Last orders, Alerts, Open cases and History of interactions.

FIGURE 33: CUSTOMER  DASHBOARD
In addition to the Global Case Search, filtering options  and action panel, Customer Connect supports
“Query to Answer” process flow and “Problem to Resolution” process flow that is used in processing cases,
issues and actions, as follows.
Query to Answer
• Customer Connect screens present appropriate information  to the Agent to search common
customer queries.
• Global search is used to identify  the contact or customer and open their overview.
• Agents can open information  about Cases, Products, Orders or Billing.
• Global search also allows the Agent to query from the Case or Order.
• The Case records all interactions with the customer at all stages.
• The Customer Summary screen provides a full set of information  about  the customer and
their services to support in the handling  of a query.
3.2.5.43.3.5.4 COMMUNICATIONS  BANNER
Customer Connect provides a message scrollbar to display information  to the Agent. Typically, these
messages will be incidents  to make the Agent aware of outages that could be affecting multiple
customers. The message scrollbar can be used for more general-purpose information displays, such as
notifying Agents of new offers to make available to customers.

For example, the Communications  Banner can be used to notify Agents of network outages, time-based
campaigns or promotions.  Messages can be quickly read by Agents without  disrupting  the ongoing
customer interaction.
The communications  banner includes the following  features:
• Messages can be broadcast to all Agents or to a specific workgroup.
• Agents can choose to collapse and expand the message scrollbar.
• The message scroll can be paused.

Banners can also be checked from Customer connect Notification Center as below:

FIGURE 34:  CUSTOMER  CONNECT  NOTIFICATION–CENTRE - BANNERS
3.2.63.3.6 CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
Encompass enables Freedom to communicate  with their  customers using the communication  channels of
email and SMS. CSG solution  ensures the message is submitted  to the relevant messaging component,  for
example, SMSC, and Email server.
Further, CSG Encompass includes a notification  framework where notifications  can be triggered and sent to
the customer when required.
The following  sections describe the built-in  notification  triggering  points.

3.2.6.13.3.6.1 CREDIT LIMIT THRESHOLD  NOTIFICATIONS
Notification  can be sent to warn the customer when the credit limit threshold  is reached. These credit
limits can be defined at the account level or the service level. When notification  monitoring  is enabled,
Encompass will monitor  and trigger a notification  if a threshold is breached. For example, when a
customer’s account balance amounts to 50% of their account credit limit, a SMS is sent to warn the
customer.
Similarly, a credit limit can be set against a service and when service level threshold notification  is enabled,
Encompass will monitor  usages against the service and trigger a notification  if a threshold is reached.
Notification  thresholds are system wide, and the default values are provided in the table below:

TABLE 8: DEFAULT CREDIT LIMIT THRESHOLD NOTIFICATIONS
NOTIFICATION TYPE THRESHOLD DESCRIPTION
Service Level Credit Limit
(for a bill period)
Reached 80%
Service usage reaches 80% of the service
credit limit.
 Reached 100%
Service usage reaches 100% of the service
credit limit.
 Reset 0% - 79%
Service usage drops below 50% of the
service credit limit, e.g. service level credit
limit increased.
 Reset 80% - 99%
Service usage drops below 100% of the
service credit limit, e.g. a new bill period
started

A notification  can trigger one or multiple actions to be performed. The following  table describes the
actions provided  by Encompass:

TABLE 9: NOTIFICATION ACTION TYPES
ACTION TYPES DESCRIPTION
Send SMS
A SMS is sent to the customer to alert them of reaching a
threshold.
Send Email
An email is sent to the customer to alert them of reaching a
threshold.  An email template will be provided for each notification
type (account level and service level).

3.2.6.23.3.6.2 CONSUMPTION  THRESHOLD NOTIFICATIONS
Notification  can be triggered when entitlement  consumption  reaches a defined threshold percentage. For
example, a customer’s product offer may include monthly data allowance entitlement, when 80% of the
included data is consumed, a SMS is sent to inform the customer.

3.2.6.33.3.6.3 ENTITLEMENT EXPIRY  NOTIFICATION
Customers are frustrated when their allocations expire without  being fully consumed.  To foster better
customer experience, CSG Encompass provides the capability to notify  customers when their entitlement
and allocation is about to expire or has expired. By cultivating  a sense of empowerment,  customer
relationship is fostered thus increasing retention  rates.
The following  table describes the notification  types provided by Encompass:

3.2.6.53.3.6.5 SUBSCRIPTION  RENEWAL  NOTIFICATION
Subscription  renewal notifications  can be sent to inform customers of their subscription  renewal outcome.
When renewals are unsuccessful, the notification  prompts the customer to resolve the renewal issue if
needed. Notification  is defined against the offer; therefore, different notifications  behaviors can be set up
for each offer.
The following  table describes the notification  types provided by Encompass:

TABLE 13: RENEWAL NOTIFICATION TYPES
NOTIFICATION TYPES DESCRIPTION
Send SMS – Renewal

Upon the generation of the customer’s bill, a notification will be promptly dispatched to inform the
customer.
3.2.6.73.3.6.7 SMS  COMMUNICATION
Encompass supports the sending of messages to the subscriber using SMS.
SMS messages can be sent via the SMSC interface by:
• The treatment monitor  for late payment notifications.
• Encompass when a high  usage (postpaid) or low funds (prepaid) threshold is breached. These
are soft thresholds which  can be breached but  trigger a warning notification  as opposed to a
credit limit which  is a hard threshold  and cannot be breached.

• The prepaid account expiry monitor  when an account is pending  expiry or when  an account is
nearing its grace period end date.
• An operational task monitor.
The SMSC needs to supply a system id and password for the connection  to use. This system id and
password should support  multiple simultaneous  connections and have correct security for the use of the
source addresses that may be used in SMS messages.
A real-time, outbound  interface to the SMSC is provided. This interface uses SMPP V3.4 messages (Short
Message Peer –o Peer - http://www.smsforum.org/)  in Transmitter mode only. The connection  is via direct
TCP/IP.
Only BIND, UNBIND, ENQUIRELINK and SUMBIT_SM PDU (Protocol Data Unit) messages are used.
The SMSC is responsible for enforcing blackout  periods during which  SMS messages should not be
forwarded.
3.2.6.83.3.6.8 EMAIL COMMUNICATION
Customer Connect allows the Agent to communicate with the customer through  emails as well as through
verbal conversations. All written  notifications sent to the customer by the Agent are tracked with the Case,
and the Case also tracks phone-based conversations with  any comments added by the Agent.
If any notifications  or interactions have taken place through  SMS, and initiated  by the Encompass backend, these are also shown in the history of interactions with the customer.
Communication  preferences for the contact can be captured. These includes preferred method  of contact
e.g. Call, Email or SMS, the preferred language, the preferred contact time e.g. Morning,  Afternoon,
Evening or at a specific time range as well as the contact’s preferred store.

3.2.6.8.43.3.6.8.4 EMAIL ADDRESSES
A pre-defined list of reply-to and from addresses can be customized, allowing the Agent to select the most
appropriate email address when composing  an email. For example, if an Agent is writing  to inform
customer of a billing  resolution, the reply-to address can be set to the billing  group billing@xxx.com.
Based on the receiver address, different actions can be created by Encompass. This ensures inbound
emails are addressed and by the most appropriate groups.  Using the billing  example above, an inbound
email sent to billing@xxx.com will trigger a “Process Billing Inquiry” action to be created.
The following  table lists the action types provided for email processing:

3.33.4 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
3.3.13.4.1 RESOURCE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
The management of inventory items is designed specifically for GSM that form part of the wireless
network. It allows the tracking and control of aspects of an inventory’s lifecycle that are related to billing
and provisioning.  Inventory  items may be either physical equipment sold to the customer such as SIM
cards or network  identifiers such as phone numbers.
Wireless inventory management supports  the following  functionality:
• Phone Number Loading (MSISDN)
Service providers are allocated a range of numbers from regulatory  bodies. It is important  to
record and track these numbers. Encompass provides the ability to load groups  of MSISDNs
into inventory  management. The MSISDN Range Load schedule type allows for a number
range to be inserted by defining a starting phone  number followed  by the quantity  of phone
numbers to be created. The MSISDN File Load schedule type allows phone numbers  to be
loaded from a file containing  specific MSISDN details. Other equipment types can be
maintained using  this functionality.
• Vanity Numbers
Vanity numbers are automatically recognized by using pattern recognition.   Encompass
automatically identifies the vanity numbers by comparison with  a pattern match file. Vanity
numbers can also be controlled  by using  the vanity category code.
• Vanity Numbers Charging
The vanity number information  can be used, through  additional configuration,  to support
one-off or recurring charges if there is a requirement to charge for these vanity numbers.

• SIM/eSIM Load
A SIM card shipment will typically be accompanied by a consignment  manifest. A file based on
this manifest, containing  a sub-set of information,  is used to load the relevant SIM details into
Encompass. The solution  provides a mechanism for loading SIM card details into Encompass
as inventory items. The loader takes a csv input  file or files containing  the following  SIM card
details: ICCID, IMSI, PIN1, PIN2, PUK1 and PUK2. It is important for a service provider to have
all this information  available to Agents so that they can deal with SIM lock and phone
activation inquiries efficiently and find SIM cards by their ICCID during sales orders.
Existing batch processes will be leveraged to load eSIM data into Encompass database.
• MSISDN Expiration
In the case of pre-paid services there are several conditions where an operator wants to
recover a MSISDN and recycle it for use by another customer. A typical example is when a
prepaid service has been unused for a period.
Encompass supports a process that allows for the re-use of an MSISDN for which the
associated product instance is no longer in use. The Encompass takes an input  file listing the
MSISDNs identified for expiration.  The following  is performed for each MSISDN in the file:
o The associated product instance is cancelled if it is a non-cancelled pre-paid product.
o The status of the MSISDN is set to ‘Quarantine’. The quarantine period will be a systemwide period.
o The status of the associated SIM card will be set to ‘Cancelled’.
o If the associated customer node has no other non-cancelled products, then the customer
node will be cancelled.
o If the associated contact has no other non-cancelled customers, then the contact will be
cancelled.
The resource management functionality  that is in place at freedom will be leveraged and be implemented
to support similar functionality  where possible.
3.3.23.4.2 BILLING EVENTS MANAGEMENT
3.3.2.13.4.2.1 EVENT PROCESSING
3.3.2.1.13.4.2.1.1 WIRELESS NORMALIZATION
Encompass enables event usage from multiple sources to be rated and guided to customer accounts. The
mechanism used to convert the incoming  usage details into  a format that Encompass can rate is termed
'normalization'. The normalized event format includes the event type and subtype  which enables
Encompass to determine the correct tariffs to apply.
Encompass supports the receipt of the events as a real-time feed.
Encompass performs file and record-level validation on the incoming  event record. This ensures that the
input  data can be processed, the minimum  set of input  data is present, and any additional  data required
for rating  and guiding  can be derived.
The following  types of event records are accepted by Encompass:
• Mobile Originated Voice Calls (MOC): Outgoing On-Net, Outgoing  Off-Net.
• Mobile Terminated Voice Calls (MTC): Incoming.
• Diverts to alternate number (DIVERT): Outgoing On-Net,  Outgoing  Off-Net.

• Divert to Roamer (ROAM): Outgoing Off-Net.
• Mobile Originated SMS (SMSMO).
• Mobile Terminated SMS (SMSMT).
• MMS (MMS): Outgoing, Incoming.
• Data/GPRS (DATA): On-Net, Off-Net.
• Streaming Data/GPRS (STREAM): On-Net, Off-Net.
• Prepaid Roaming (CAMEL): USSD Callback, CAP3.
Encompass performs the following  checks:
• Data within  a record matches the expected data type, length,  range, etc.
• The chargeable party MSISDN exists for the charge start date.
• For roaming records, the chargeable party IMSI exists for the charge start date.

Encompass classifies each received usage record based on information  in the event record and assigns the
usage record to an event type and subtype.  These are:
• Voice: On-Net,  Off-Net PSTN, Off-Net Other Mobile, Off-Net VoIP, Incoming.
• Voice Special: Emergency, Call Centre, IVR, Activations Hotline, Voicemail, Free Call, Directory
Assistance, National Operator, International  Operator.
• Voice International  (at least one subtype for each international  country): the service is
determined by dialed number  prefix matching against the IDD country code and potentially
NPA within  that country code.
• Voice Content:  there is one subtype for each content  type that requires separate rating
behavior. This list is configurable and extensible as new content sources come online.
• SMS: On-Net, Off-Net National,  International,  Received.
• MMS: On-Net, Off-Net National, International,  Received.
• Data: On-Net Sent, Off-Net Sent, On-Net Received, Off-Net Received, On-Net Streamed Sent,
Off-Net Streamed Sent, On-Net Streamed Received, Off-Net Streamed Received.
• SMS Content: there is one subtype for each content  type that requires separate rating
behavior. This list is configurable and extensible as new content sources come online.
• MMS Content: there is one subtype for each content type that requires separate rating
behavior. This list is configurable and extensible as new content sources come online.
• Data Content: there is one subtype for each content type that requires separate rating
behavior. This list is configurable and extensible as new content sources come online.
3.3.33.4.3  CHARGE CALCULATION AND BALANCE MANAGEMENT
3.3.3.13.4.3.1 RATING
Encompass offers a convergent rating framework.  As a central component to the convergent billing
solution  this framework is based on industry  standards. The concepts from TMForum Shared Information
and Data (SID) model have been applied to allow flexible implementation  of innovative price offerings.
The core concepts revolve around five key entities, pictured  below.

International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 86 of 169

FIGURE 36: RATING ENTITIES

The prices that apply for a product  are described by one or more offers (Product Offering). For example,
these typically include a primary product offering and alternate offers associated with Packages on the
product.
Examples of alternate offers are:
• Additional  prices for service types not covered by the primary offer (e.g. mobile phone with a
VOIP offer).
• Price over-rides that give better price (e.g. family and friends and offer upgrades).
• Discounts that alter the price of the primary offer (e.g. mobile data and home-data offers for
the same customer, leading to a discount).
Encompass provides three key parameters to route the event to the pricing configuration:
• Product  offer.
• Event type.
• Event subtype.
For example, the event type might  be Voice National, Voice International,  VOIP, MMS, Personalized Ring
Back Tone subscription  event or GPRS session. The event subtype is used to classify sub-categories of an
event type, such as Voice National On-net and Off-net.
Encompass provides a framework to support  complex pricing whilst  providing  a high level of reuse to
remove replication of pricing configuration  by using many-to-many  relationship between Product  Offering
Price and Component Price.
The rating logic finds all Product Offering  Prices eligible for a combination  of offering,  event type and
event subtype, applies priority  rules on the eligible Product  Offering Prices and then calculates a charge
for each. For example, the sequence of the charging calculation could be first applied per-event charges,
then flat rate charges, and then apply discounts.  The same framework is used for usage charges and
discounts.  Each charge component can be calculated separately with its own  charge method.
Any one of these components may be reused by another offering or within  the same offering under
another event type and event subtype.
The parameters used to calculate the component  charge are defined in the Component  Price Book. These
include:

• Timeband.
• Charge method.
• Rate, fixed amount, markup percentage.
• Units of measure, initial and increment unit, as well as conversion metric.
3.3.3.1.13.4.3.1.1 CHARGE DEFINITION METHODS
Encompass supports the types of Charge Method shown  in the following  table.

TABLE 17: SUPPORTED CHARGE METHOD TYPES

This method  is commonly
used for voice calls, data
sessions or SMS or MMS with
multiple  messages per event.
The charge depends on the
amount  of usage and a single
rate per chargeable unit.  An
example of a flat rate is 10c
per minute.

consumed, after which  a
new block is allocated
automatically. If a new
block is started, then the
flat rate applies.
This method  is commonly
used for data charging  as
consumption-in-blocks  is
easy to comprehend  and
track for the end users.

PassThrough
Pre-rated events from
external systems.
The charge is copied
from the incoming  event.
A charge provided by a third
party on the incoming  event.

For Charge Methods that include a flat rate component, Encompass will determine the Quantity  of Units to
be charged from the event. For example, the Charge Metric may stipulate that the event's duration is used,
and that this is interpreted  as a number of seconds.
If the Charge Method includes a flat rate component, Encompass will apply a charge to the event as
follows:
• The charge is calculated as the number of chargeable units multiplied  by the rate specified on
the Component Price. This charge is then applied to the event.
• The Component  Price may specify an increment size or granularity.  If this is not equal to 1,
then Encompass will convert the chargeable quantity into  several increments. Increments are
always charged in full, even if only partially used. For example, a 30 second call that is rated in
10 second increments will be charged as 3 increments. A 27 second call or a 21 second call will
also be charged as 3 increments.
3.3.3.1.23.4.3.1.2 SPECIAL DAYS
A table of special days can be maintained by Freedom. This is a system-wide list and does not vary by time
band profile. Special day entries are required for each specific date, i.e. annual holidays must be entered
separately each year.
The system will check if the charge start date-time falls within  a special day by looking  up a defined table
of special days.
Encompass determines a timeband by looking  up the timeband  Profile Table for the timeband  profile. This
is done using:
• The event day of week or special day-type (if applicable) just determined for this event.
• The event's charge start date-time.
Each entry in the table will consist of a period (period start, peri–d end) - the period into which the start
date-time falls is identified.
3.3.3.1.33.4.3.1.3 RATING SUBTOTALS
Rating subtotals in Encompass provide  a means of maintaining  aggregates during  rating and using them
in rating algorithms. This means that aggregates can be set, fetched and modified at rating time, thus
facilitating the use of aggregate values in rating algorithms. Subtotal  aggregates may be monetary or nonmonetary.
Rating subtotals are used to aggregate any sort of data related to events that would  be used in rating
algorithms.  For example, to monitor spend control and data policy to trigger throttling.
Rating subtotals are designed to be bound  by a start date and end date. Generally, aggregates are daily
but may be configured using  expressions to determine the date range. This provides excellent flexibility to
define a rating subtotal that automatically refreshes each date range period. It also means that no matter
when the events are processed (either real-time or batch) the values are guided to the correct date range.
3.3.3.1.43.4.3.1.4 CHARGE ROUNDING
Charges in Encompass will be rounded to 2 decimal places, with 5 and higher rounded  up.

3.3.3.23.4.3.2 ENTITLEMENTS (FREE UNITS)
CSG Encompass supports entitlements,  which are an allotment  of units such as time, bandwidth  or money
that can be consumed by eligible events before charges are applied to an account. Entitlements can also
be referred to as free units.
Entitlements can:
• Be Subscription based, reward based, one-off,  recurring,
• Have different roll-over policies with different priorities,
• Have various thresholds along with  the relevant notifications.
• Be shared, pooled and donated from customer A to customer B.
• Be part of a hierarchy and/or group

FIGURE 37:  ENTITLEMENT (FREE  UNITS) ALLOWANCES

Encompass entitlements  follow a countdown  model. This is where an allocation of units is made on
instantiation  of the entitlements.  Deductions are then made against the allocation over time until either
the entitlement is consumed or expires, whichever occurs first.

FIGURE 38: COUNTDOWN MODEL FOR CONSUMPTION OF UNITS

A customer may have many entitlements  active across a broad range of different types of services.
Entitlements may be assigned to a service, a customer or to a customer hierarchy for group  entitlements.
The configuration  of an entitlement  is based on the following  factors:
• The number of units together with  the unit  measure allocated (e.g. 10 minutes, 22 seats,
10.5MB etc.).
• The validity period (i.e. the start date and expiration date). An entitlement  can also be defined
to never expire.
• The refresh period, allowing  an entitlement  to automatically repeat (e.g. daily, monthly,
weekly, one-off).
As standard the following  countdown  entitlement  types are provided.

TABLE 18: ENTITLEMENT TYPES AVAILABLE
ENTITLEMENT TYPES DESCRIPTION
Included Data x GB of data volume will be free for a configurable  expiry period.
Unlimited Data All data volume will be free for a set expiry period.
Included SMS x SMS will be free for a configurable expiry period.
Unlimited SMS All SMS will be free for a set expiry period.
Included Voice x minutes  of voice will be free for a configurable expiry period.
Unlimited Voice All voice minutes will be free for a set expiry period
Included $ Value $x of charge value will be free for a configurable expiry period.
QoS Bandwidth
A certain level of bandwidth  (e.g. 8Mbps, 1Mbps) will be available for a
given amount of data volume.

A single entitlement  type may be used in many product  offerings.

For an entitlement  to be consumed by an event, it must be eligible for the event and valid for the time
period. For example, a subscription  charge will not consume from voice minutes allowance. As
entitlements are date-ranged, the time of the event determines which entitlements are “active”. Further,
recurring entitlements which  have not expired may still be consumed. These will be consumed from oldest
to latest and may be considered “roll-over” functionality.
Once the entitlement  allocation has reached zero, the allocation pool has been exhausted. If there are
multiple  eligible allocation pools, then the next available allocation will be used. This allocation might be at
a higher level in the customer’s hierarchy, i.e. it may be a shared pool.
Encompass also provides the following  trigger points for entitlements:
• When an entitlement  allocation is first used.
• When the entitlement is allocated or refreshed.
• When the entitlement allowance is about to expire.
• When the entitlement allowance expires.
3.3.3.2.13.4.3.2.1 MILESTONE ENTITLEMENTS
Encompass can be configured  to provide a discount or free units once a milestone or threshold has been
reached. These are typically time-based thresholds (e.g. daily), comprised of two configuration
components:  a unit counter and a configured threshold  of units.
A simplistic example of a milestone entitlement  is where the first 5 SMS of the day are charged at a
standard price and then all other SMS for the day are free (up to a fair usage amount).  Reaching a
milestone may result in an entitlement.   A typical marketing use of such an entitlement is as an
inducement to encourage customers to ‘use’ more of a service or call type, with for example the aim of
increasing ARPU and changing customer behavior over time.
For example, a provider may wish to provide 50MB of free download to a customer when the customer’s
total daily spend has exceeded $10.  In this case two entitlements  are created for the customer: one for
the purposes of tracking a specific milestone and another that provides the benefit of 50MB download  to
the customer when the threshold  of $10 spend is reached.  The beneficial entitlement  will not become
active until the threshold  entitlement has been exceeded.
3.3.3.2.23.4.3.2.2 ENTITLEMENT WARNING/EXPIRY NOTIFICATION
CSG Encompass provides the following notification trigger points for entitlements:
• When an entitlement  allocation is first used.
• When the entitlement is allocated or refreshed.
• When entitlement  consumption  reaches a defined threshold  percentage.
o For example, a customer’s product offer may include monthly data allowance
entitlement,  when 80% of the included  data is consumed then the customer is notified
• When the entitlement allowance is about to expire.
• When the entitlement allowance expires.
In addition to the trigger points for entitlement above, notification  can be sent to notify  the customer of an
upcoming  expiry or expired entitlement.  For example, at 5 days before the special rate expires, an SMS is
sent to inform the customer. Notification  is only triggered if the entitlement balance is not  fully consumed.
The following  table describes the notification  types that can be defined as standard.

3.3.3.2.33.4.3.2.3 ALLOWANCE TRANSFER
Encompass provides the capability for customers to transfer entitlements  to another customer on the
same network.  This improves customer satisfaction and retention  by granting  more freedom to how
customers utilize their entitlements.
Freedom can restrict and define the types of entitlements eligible for transfer via configuration.  To
minimize fraudulent activities additional configurable  validations are supported.  A few exemplary
validations are listed below:
• The minimum/maximum  amount of an entitlement  transfer
• The maximum number  of entitlement  transfers a customer can send within  a 24-hour or 30day period.
• The maximum number  of entitlement  transfers a customer can receive within  a 24-hour or
30-day period.
• The minimum  entitlement  balance a customer must have after the entitlement transfer.
• The minimum  number of days prior to the entitlement  expiry date required to send an
entitlement  transfer.
• An entitlement  transfer transaction fee may be charged to the sender.
3.3.3.33.4.3.3 ONE-OFF  (NON-RECURRING) CHARGES
Encompass supports the application  of many different types of one-off charges to customers in a variety of
circumstances. Some one-off charges may be common  to several products while others are product
specific. To help structure the charges for analysis and processing the charges are categorized by one-off
charge type and reason.
A sample structure is displayed in the figure below.

One-off charges are distinct from the two other main categories of charges i.e. usage and recurring
charges. Encompass one-off charges can be automatically calculated at billing  time and manually created
through  an interface. Encompass one-off charges can also be calculated in real-time through  the use of
Encompass entitlements.
Encompass is configured  with the following  set of one-off charge types:

TABLE 20: ONE-OFF CHARGE TYPES
CHARGE TYPE BEHAVIOR
Product/ Service/ Feature
activation and
cancellation fees
The amount  to charge for the activation and cancellation fee is
determined by the product/feature, the rate plan in effect at
activation time and the contract type (if applicable).
When a contract is in effect at cancellation time, the fee calculation
varies based on the remaining contract duration.
Component  activation fee
The amount  to charge is determined  by the MSISDN pool and
category (i.e. gold,  silver, bronze and standard). This fee is charged
once for each MSISDN used by a product.  Therefore, if an MSISDN
swap is performed,  this activation fee is re-triggered.
SIM and MSISDN swap
fees
The amount  to charge is based solely on the action taking place
and is independent  of product  and subscriber attributes.

These charges are passed onto billing  for inclusion  on the next invoice. One-off charges will always appear
on standard bill runs.
One-off fees may be waived on a product-by-product  basis. When activating a new product  or feature, an
authorized user may enter a Waive Reason to indicate that all activation charges for that product or
feature should  be waived. The original one-off charge is displayed on the invoice as well as the waived
reverse charge to highlight  the benefit  to the subscriber.
3.3.3.3.13.4.3.3.1 SYSTEM GENERATED ONE-OFF CHARGE
Depending  on Freedom’s charging requirements, system generated one-off charges can be applied
against a customer’s account or against a service.  The following one-off charges are provided by
Encompass:

TABLE 21: SYSTEM ONE-OFF CHARGE
ONE-OFF CHARGE DESCRIPTION
Equipment  Swap
A service level one-off charge is generated when the
customer requests for an equipment  swap, such as
changing  a SIM card.
Top Level Offer Change
A service level one-off charge is generated when the toplevel offer of the service changes.

3.3.3.3.23.4.3.3.2 AD HOC ONE-OFF CHARGE
From time to time, Freedom may charge for support  and maintenance time provided to a customer. These
charges are applied manually and are referred to as ad-hoc one-off charges. Encompass provides the
capability for ad-hoc one-off charge amounts to be overridden where required.
3.3.3.3.33.4.3.3.3 ACTIVATION AND CANCELLATION CHARGE
Encompass supports the application  of one-off charges when a service or product is activated and
cancelled. The following  one-off charges are provided for activation and cancellation.

TABLE 22: ACTIVATION AND CANCELLATION ONE-OFF CHARGES
ONE-OFF CHARGE DESCRIPTION
For a service activation A service-level activation one-off charge is generated.
For a service cancellation A service-level cancellation one-off charge is generated.
For a product (or child product) activation
A product or child product-level activation one-off charge
is generated
For a product (or child product) cancellation
A product or child product-level cancellation one-off
charge is generated

Encompass will automatically calculate activation and cancellation charges at billing  time based on the
product  model definition.
3.3.3.3.43.4.3.3.4 REAL-TIME ACTIVATION AND CANCELLATION CHARGE
Encompass provides real-time activation and cancellation charges to support real-time processing and
balance management. These charges are represented as one-off charge offer components.  Service
providers can add one-off charge components to any offer that requires subscription  activation and/or
cancellation charges.
The following  real-time one-off charge components  are provided for activation and cancellation:

TABLE 23: REAL-TIME ONE-OFF CHARGE COMPONENTS

REAL-TIME ONE-OFF

DESCRIPTION
Service – no
provisioning
When associated with an offer, a successful reservation must be
made against the customer’s account before the component is
activated. The activation may trigger the generation  of a servicelevel one-off charge.
When cancelled, a service level cancellation charge may be
generated.

Feature – no
provisioning
When associated with an offer, a successful reservation must be
made against the customer’s account before the component is
activated. The activation may trigger the generation  of a product  or
child product-level one-off charge.
When cancelled, a product  or child product-level cancellation charge
may be generated.
Service require
provisioning
When associated with an offer, it depicts the need for successful
reservation and provisioning  before the component  will be active.
Once active, a service-level one-off charge may be generated.
When cancelled, a service level cancellation charge may be
generated.
Feature require
provisioning
When associated with an offer, it depicts the need for successful
reservation and provisioning  before the component  will be active.
Once active, a product or child product-level  one-off charge may be
generated.
When cancelled, a product  or child product-level cancellation charge
may be generated.

The activation and cancellation charges are configurable in Encompass. Furthermore,  each subscription
will have a subscription  period defined. The cancellation charge is only generated when the subscription  is
cancelled prior to the subscription  expiry. Encompass provides the ability for a cancellation reason to be
captured.
3.3.3.43.4.3.4 RECURRING CHARGES
Charges that occur on a periodic basis, such as rental and fees for service plans, need different treatment
than usage tariffs and are referred to as recurring tariffs. These events are derived from product offer
information  which indicates the need for recurring charges.
Encompass provides a framework to configure  recurring tariffs. The existence of recurring components
from the product  model will generate the recurring event/s required. The solution  provides several preconfigured  recurring tariffs that are mapped into  the product  model.
3.3.3.4.13.4.3.4.1 ACTIVATION DATE ALIGNMENT PRO-RATION
Service-level recurring charges will be aligned to their activation date. This date may not align with the
customer’s bill cycle. When a service is cancelled, Encompass can refund advance charges using
adjustments.  The following  figure provides a simple framing of the concept for a pro-rate out example
where the product/component  is billed in advance.

FIGURE 40: PRO-RATE ADJUSTMENT ON SERVICE  CANCELLATION

3.3.3.4.23.4.3.4.2 TYPES OF RECURRING TARIFFS
Encompass provides the following  recurring tariffs:

TABLE 24: RECURRING TARIFFS
RECURRING TARIFF DESCRIPTION
For a service in advance
A service-level monthly recurring charge is generated. The period being
charged is in advance of the bill run date.
For a service in arrears
A service-level monthly recurring charge is generated. The period being
charged is up to and including  the bill run date.
For a product (or child
product) in advance
A product or child product-level monthly  recurring charge is generated.
The period being charged is in advance of the bill run date.
For a product (or child
product) in arrears
A product or child product-level monthly  recurring charge is generated.
The period being charged is up to and including  the bill run date.

The recurring tariffs parameters are based on the product  model. For example, the price book attached to
the product offer of the service will define the recurring tariff charge amount for the service.
3.3.3.4.33.4.3.4.3 BILL CYCLE ALIGNMENT PRO-RATION
Encompass has the capability to perform pro-ration,  at either the beginning  or end of a product  or service
subscription.
Product recurring charges will align to the customer’s bill cycle. Any discrepancy between the product start
date and the bill cycle alignment  will be handled by pro-rating.  The following  diagram provides a simple
framing of the concept for a pro-rate in example where the product/component  is billed in advance.

FIGURE 41: PRO-RATE AND BILL CYCLE  ALIGNMENT FOR RECURRING  CHARGES ON
PRODUCTS

Calculations for pro-ration will occur using  increments of 1 day for the period of a whole day. For example,
if the customer signs up for a product when part-way through  their current bill cycle then they will be
charged in 1 day increments up to the start of their bill cycle and then for the full bill cycle period.
Period calculation will use the customer’s invoice date. For example, if the customer is billed o
n
the 20th
day of each month,  the recurring charge will be calculated for the peri
od
 of 21st January 00:00:00 to 20
February 23:59:59.
3.3.3.4.3.13.4.3.4.3.1 Daily Pro-Ration
In this option, calculations for pro-ration  will occur using increments of 1 day for the period of a whole day.
For example, if the customer signs up to a product when  part-way through  their current bill cycle, then
they will be charged in 1 day increments up to the start of their bill cycle, and then for the full bill cycle
period.
3.3.3.4.43.4.3.4.4 REAL-TIME RECURRING TARIFFS
Real-time recurring tariffs provide Freedom the flexibility  to launch new offers without  being bound  by
time constraints, such as monthly  bill cycle. Encompass models these tariffs as product components  giving
service providers the ability to add these components  to any offer that requires real-time recurring
charges. The recurring periods for the recurring components are configurable e.g. days, months, years.
The initial charge is triggered upon  activation of the real-time recurring component,  while subsequent
recurring charges are generated on the start of each recurring period. No refund or pro-ration will occur if
the recurring component  is cancelled midway through  the recurring period.
The following  real-time recurring components  are provided:

3.3.3.53.4.3.5 BALANCE MANAGEMENT
Encompass contains a real-time convergent charging module  that supports concurrent rating and balance
management for prepaid and postpaid  accounts (asset and liability) across all types of service. This allows
all services to be offered to customers regardless of their account type and also supports dynamic
switching  between prepaid and postpaid  accounts.
The solution provides event authorization,  addition  or deduction  of monetary or non-monetary  amounts,
usage limit enforcement, affiliate account processing and in-call notifications.
A prepaid account type will be used within Encompass to restrict usage based on state transitions and
balance expiry.
In the case of a prepaid account, the rating is rejected if the charged service is suspended or cancelled.
Please refer to Encompass’s product model described above for the supported service states.
3.3.3.5.13.4.3.5.1 SERVICE-CONSUMPTION RESERVATION AND AUTHORIZATION
When a service authorization request for an event is sent to a customer's account, an appropriate
monetary amount is reserved from the account balance and held as a deposit, and the request is
authorized. Encompass provides time/volume/quantity  back to the service platform.

When managing session transactions (i.e. the final cost varies based on the duration or volume of the
session) the final cost cannot be determined  at the start of the session, Encompass makes an initial
reservation (subject to available credit) to enable the transaction to commence. If the customer’s account
has insufficient  funds to initiate the transaction, the service request is rejected, and the transaction fails.
When the first token is depleted, another request is sent from the service platform (using identical rules to
that of creation) to extend the existing reservation. Multiple extensions can be applied to a reservation.
The following  figure is an example of system interaction  and how  reservations are applied using the
Encompass Commerce Engine.

FIGURE 42:  BALANCE  MANAGEMENT - MULTIPLE  RESERVATIONS

When the service event is complete, the reservation is committed  and Encompass:
• Rates the event with  the exact duration  or volume to calculate a final charge for the
transaction.
• Clears the reservation for that transaction.
• Commits this charge to the customer's chosen account, which  supersedes any reservation
amount.  Unused units  are credited back into the balance when the session is released.
Encompass Commerce Engine expires a reservation if its reservation extension or debit request is not
received within  a configurable timeframe, for example, 10 minutes. Reservation expiry may occur when
the service controller fails before a reservation/debit response is received from the Encompass Commerce
Engine.

Encompass Commerce Engine reservations functionality  enables multiple  devices and services to draw on
the same account at the same time. This enables multiple  services to use funds (prepaid) or available
credit (postpaid) from a common account.
In the case of prepaid accounts, all concurrent consuming  services will compete for the remaining  prepaid
funds and multiple requests will be denied when the funds are depleted. The reverse occurs when a single
top-up  is made to the convergent  prepaid account,  i.e. all-consuming  prepaid services will be able to
generate usage again.
The following  figure shows how multiple  reservations are tracked within  an available pool of funds or
credits.

FIGURE 43:  MULTIPLE  RESERVATIONS  AGAINST  AVAILABLE  POOL

In the case of postpaid accounts, any consuming services will compete for the remaining available credit
and multiple requests will be denied when the credit limit is reached. For example, this may be important
for international  calls that may be expensive to the service provider. A single payment to the convergent
postpaid invoicing  account will enable all the consuming  postpaid services to generate usage again.
Encompass Commerce Engine is capable of providing  real time roll-up balances within a customer
hierarchy thus enabling  the subordinate  services of child customers to be bound  by a single credit limit (or
available funds) at the invoicing or parent customer.
3.3.3.5.23.4.3.5.2 REAL-TIME SERVICE AUTHORIZATION AND ACCOUNTING
Encompass Commerce Engine offers real-time service authorization to identify that a service is available to
a customer. Encompass Commerce Engine enables the control of all financial aspects of a transaction
before, during and after the event. It will authorize events before those events occur, check balances
throughout  the event and ensure up-to-the-second  account balance information.
If a customer attempts to use a service that they are not subscribed to or which is not active on the
network,  then an appropriate response will be returned. Additional  checks such as usage limit
enforcement and affiliate account processing may be included as part of the authorization process on a
per customer basis.
At the end of the session or completion  of the event, the event detail record is rated and committed  to the
target account. The network supplies the information  on the number  of units actually used versus the
number of units reserved within the Commerce Engine. This ensures that all prepaid accounts are updated
to reflect actual event charges in near real time and the unbilled  balance of a postpaid account is always
kept up to date.

3.3.3.5.33.4.3.5.3 RATING & CHARGING NOTIFICATIONS
CSG Billing  provides a comprehensive module  for issuing notifications  (alerts), predominantly  from rating,
however this can be applied anywhere else in the solution.
Notifications  can be triggered at various points within  CSG Billing including  the following  features:
• Credit Limit Monitoring
• Balance Monitoring
• Spend Limit Monitoring
• Usage Limit Monitoring
• Free Units Consumption  and Expiry
• Policy Monitoring
Notifications  can be sent through  the following  channels
• SMS
• Email
3.3.3.5.43.4.3.5.4 IN-CALL NOTIFICATIONS
Encompass Commerce Engine provides information  regarding the state of a subscriber’s service and
account to the Service Control Point  (SCP) for use in in-call notifications.
The following  information/warnings  are supplied:
Before an event is authorized
• What is the balance of the target account?
• That the target prepaid account has expired.
• That the balance of the target account is low or nearing its credit limit.
• That the requested service has not been subscribed to
• That the requested service is not active.
During an event
• That the final extension (token) has been issued.
• The session length.
The SCP is responsible for appropriately notifying  the subscriber in response to the information  supplied
by Encompass Commerce Engine.
3.3.3.5.53.4.3.5.5 USAGE LIMIT ENFORCEMENT
Encompass Commerce Engine will, as part of the event authorization,  check for any service-level usage
limits that apply to the event. If the event will breach a pre-defined usage limit, then the request is denied,
and an appropriate response returned.
3.3.3.5.63.4.3.5.6 SPEND CONTROLS
Encompass enables the definition  of spend controls for the following  service categories:
• Data
• Content
• Voice

Page 102 of 169

• Messaging, and
• Roaming
Spend controls are defined by the following  items:
• A main threshold  value, defined as either a monetary amount  or volume
• One or more actions to be executed upon reaching the main threshold
The possible actions upon  reaching the main spend threshold are:
• Do not authorize the chargeable service, preventing the threshold being exceeded
• Send SMS
• Send email
• “Do nothing”
3.3.3.5.73.4.3.5.7 RECHARGE AND ACCOUNT VALIDITY
The Encompass balance management module  supports account recharge and the associated account
validity calculations. Account recharges made against a prepaid account may be configured  to extend
account validity. Validity extension  is defined against the payment type and the payment amount.  For
example, a recharge payment of $100 can be set up to extend the account expiry for 30 days while a
recharge payment of $200 will extend the account expiry by 50 days.
3.3.3.63.4.3.6 POLICY MANAGEMENT
Encompass provides the functionality  of associating subscriber-focused policy and charging control  using
integration  to a policy and charging rules function  server (PCRF). The following sections describe the
supported  interface(s).
3.3.3.6.13.4.3.6.1 SY INTERFACE
The Sy reference point resides between the PCRF and the OCS (Encompass). The Sy reference point
enables transfer of policy counter status information  relating to subscriber spending  from the OCS to the
PCRF.
Encompass’s real-time diameter interface supports the following request types:
• SLR_INITIAL_REQUEST
• STR_REQUEST
• SNR_REQUEST
These request types support the following  functions:
Spending-Limit-Request (SLR) Request for reporting of policy counter status information  from PCRF to
OCS and subscribe to or unsubscribe from spending limit reports.
Spending-Limit-Answer (SLA) Report of policy counter status information  upon  a PCRF request from OCS
to PCRF.
Spending-Status-Notification-Request and Spending-Status-Notification-Answer (SNR and SNA)
Notification  of spending  limit reports from OCS to PCRF.
Session-Termination-Request and Session-Termination-Answer (STR and STA) Cancellation of
spending  limit reporting from PCRF to OCS.
The figure below illustrates the interactions and signaling between the various network  elements when
the Encompass (OCS) detects a change in status of a policy counter for the session

3.3.3.73.4.3.7 NETWORK INTEGRATION
The Diameter Commerce Engine Adapter (DCEA) handles the communication interactions between the
network  and the Encompass Online Charging  System (OCS).

FIGURE 44:  INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ENCOMPASS AND THE NETWORK

Encompass provides a single charging  system for convergent  billing solutions.  This provides flexibility for
centralized charging rules that may be applied to either real-time or post-processed requests. This section
describes the functionality  associated with Diameter for the purposes of Gy and Ro interfaces.
Diameter Commerce Engine Adapters (DCEA) CCR requests will be processed using the following  function
calls:
• Credit-Control-Request-Initial (CCR-I) Service authorization request (e.g. initial event
authorization).
• Credit-Control-Request-Update (CCR-U) Service extension request (e.g. event continuation
with granted-service-unit  AVPs).
• Credit-Control-Request-Terminate (CCR-T) Debit request (e.g. event completion  reflecting
actual charge as opposed to the reserved amount).
• Credit-Control-Request-Event (CCR-E) Debit request with authorization  (e.g. authorize and
charge the actual amount  in one call).
When an authorization  is denied the adapter(s) returns an appropriate response:
• Insufficient  credit (e.g. post-paid  available credit is inadequate to let the event proceed).
• Unknown  subscriber (e.g. this subscriber may be active on the network  but is not active or
does not exist in Encompass).
• Service is currently unavailable (e.g. the requested service is either not active in Encompass or
on the network).

3.3.3.7.13.4.3.7.1 ROBUSTNESS
Robustness support  is also included as standard to detect and mitigate the risk of DCEA connectivity or
connecting  network client failure.
In the event of an adapter failure Encompass detects the following  conditions and mitigates the risk:
• Authorization  Response Lost.
• Debit Request Lost.
• Debit Response Lost.
In the scenario where Encompass is unable to deliver the request back to the network, possibly due to
communications  failure or failure of the network  client, the Encompass reservation framework will clear
the reservation. Encompass reservations contain expiry functionality  which can be set on event type and
event subtype granularity.
3.3.3.7.23.4.3.7.2 COMPLIANCE
The support for Ro reference point is according to the 3GPP TS 32.299 “Diameter Charging Applications”
specification, including support for RFC 3588 “Diameter Base Protocol” and RFC 4006 “Diameter Credit
Control Application”, with the following exceptions to RFC 3588:
• Section 2.1.1, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol  (SCTP) is not supported.
• Section 2.2, Diameter nodes implementing  Transport Layer Security (TLS) are not supported.
• Section 4.1, End to end security for individual  Attribute  Value Pairs (AVPs) is not supported.
• Section 4.3, the procedure to handle the time value overflow is not followed.  (This is a
function  to extend the AVP base Time format).
3.3.43.4.4 BILL CALCULATION
3.3.4.13.4.4.1 BILL  CHARGE CALCULATION
During billing,  CSG Billing processes the customer information,  events, and charges to generate invoice
data records and invoice images for postpaid  services.
The process, illustrated in the following  figure, includes the aggregation  of one-off,  recurring, usage
charges and tax calculation from all levels in the customer’s hierarchy.
CSG Billing executes the bill run steps in an ordered sequence, from one specified step to another
specified step, for each customer hierarchy. This allows, for example, an invoice file to be generated but
not applied to the account,  allowing the invoice to be checked prior to updating  the customer account
balance.
Each of these bills run steps are performed on all the customers and customer hierarchies that have been
assigned to the bill cycle being run as of the bill cycle effective date.

FIGURE 109: BILL CALCULATION IN CSG BILLING
CSG Billing provides the following  billing  functionality:
• Aggregates  one  off,  recurring  and  usage  charges,  credits,  payments,  adjustments,  fees,  taxes,
application of discounts and calculation of bill totals.
• Calculates taxes, with tax charges shown as a separate line on the invoice.
• Separates the bill execution date and bill effective date.
• Generates  bills  as  part  of  a  scheduled  billing   cycle  of  any  frequency;   daily,  weekly,  monthly,
quarterly, annually.
• Generates out-of-cycle bills, for example, on-demand  billing.
• Execute  multiple  bill  runs  on  a  given  day  and  in  parallel  Provided  there  is  sufficient  hardware
resources   to   cater   to   processing   need   without    negatively   impacting   system   availability   &
performance
• Executes different types of bill run including  standard bills and quality assurance bill runs.
• Controls  the  bill  cycle  activities  necessary for  the  production   of  the  invoice  including  providing
visibility of the progress of the bill run.
3.3.4.23.4.4.2 DISCOUNTS CALCULATION
3.3.4.2.13.4.4.2.1 POSTPAID DISCOUNTS
Postpaid discounts  are calculated at billing time and apply to charges of a configurable set of charge
types.  The charge types available for billing discounts  can include usage, recurring or one-time charges.
All billing  discounts are calculated in parallel.
The billing-time  discounts available in Encompass are based on aggregates at the Product Offering level,
but also accommodate customer-specific discounting  methods.   Note that any customer-specific discounts
are only applicable to charges within  the customer node.
These discounts are applied if the product  in question is associated with the discount at the bill run
effective date, regardless of whether the discount was only added to the product  for part of the period.
Similarly, if the discount  is removed from the product prior to the bill run effective date, then the discount
does not apply to any portion  of the bill period.
The proposed solution  will deliver:
• Pre-authorized payment discount,  flat monetary discount
• Friends and family discount,  percentage based monetary discount

Additional  discount schemes may require customized changes to the framework. These customized
changes are not in scope.
3.3.4.33.4.4.3 INVOICE GENERATION
During billing, Encompass processes the customer information,  events and charges to generate invoice
data records and invoice images for postpaid  services.  The process, illustrated in the following  figure,
includes the aggregation  of one-off, recurring, usage charges and tax calculation from all levels in the
customer’s hierarchy.
Encompass executes the bill run steps in an ordered sequence, from a specified step to another specified
step, for each customer hierarchy. This allows, for example, an invoice file to be generated but not applied
to the account, allowing  the invoice to be checked prior to updating  the customer account balance.
Each of these bill run steps are performed on all the customers and customer hierarchies that have been
assigned to the bill cycle being run as of the bill cycle effective date.

FIGURE 45:  BILL RUN PROCESS
Bill cycles are run periodically as bill runs. All the accounts attached to the customers that are assigned to
the bill cycle are included in the bill run. Encompass supports  multiple billing  cycles and multiple
hierarchies per bill cycle. A bill run is assigned an effective date which may differ from the actual date the
bill run is executed. The effective date is used as the:
• Upper date bound  for any charges included in the bill run.
• The date at which all customer, account and product  information  is examined
• Basis date for any recurring charges.
• Date to apply any generated invoices to the account balances of the billed accounts.
The smallest unit that can be billed is a customer hierarchy. Either all the accounts attached to the
customers in a hierarchy are processed or none are.
Every primary account attached to a customer included in the bill run has an invoice generated for it. The
invoice includes all charges assigned to the account that:
• Have been previously included  on an invoice, and
• Have a charge date less than or equal to the bill run effective date.
Each invoice includes a financial amount in the account currency that is the total of all the charges that
were billed on the invoice. This is the amount  that the account balance of the associated account is
modified by when the invoice is applied to the account.

Secondary accounts can hold monetary (e.g. deposit) or non-monetary  (e.g. loyalty points) values for
reporting  purposes. Secondary account balances do not affect the primary account balance unless a
deliberate transfer of funds is requested. For secondary accounts, the invoice amount  is the total of all
charges billed directly to the secondary account.
Invoice amounts are rounded to the rules based on the account currency, to a maximum  precision of 3
decimal places.
Each invoice is assigned an invoice type which  governs its behavior. The type assigned to an invoice is
determined ‘by the 'type' of the account.
Encompass allows customer nodes within  a customer hierarchy to be assigned a specific invoice behavior.
These behaviors are:
• Invoice: This indicates that the primary account for this customer is a receivable account. The
invoiced amount  is the total of all charges for the account itself plus the total of all charges for
all child statements and none type of accounts. The root node of any customer hierarchy
must be an invoice reporting  level.
• None: This indicates that the primary account for this customer is used for logical grouping  or
reporting  purposes only.  The invoice amount  is always zero as the total amount of any
charges is aggregated up to the next highest invoice point  in the customer hierarchy.
Accounts of this type are not receivable and cannot hold  a balance. These account types may
be useful within  a corporate or business hierarchy to replicate a logical accounting structure
where the account does not pay bills, as no invoice or document  is produced for the account.
• Statement: Statement accounts are like accounts having the invoice behavior of “None”, as
accounts of this type are not receivable and cannot  hold a balance. However, unlike  the
invoice behavior of “None”, statement accounts do receive a statement of charges the
business unit  incurred. This statement is for informational  purposes only, as the account is
not intended  to pay a bill.
Note the ability to use the statement behavior depends on the definition  of a suitable
statement style document  template that can be generated for these accounts.
• Transferred Statement: Encompass can associate customer hierarchies in a way that
consolidates the invoice balances back to an account on a different hierarchy. By setting  the
top-level customer node to have invoice behavior of “Transferred Statement” and identifying
an account to transfer to, a self-contained sub-hierarchy can be created where the payment
responsibility  is redirected.
This functionality  is useful in a corporate or business setting. For example, a sales team may
have a special hierarchy-wide discount arranged for the sales team structure only. Using
“Transferred Statement” invoice behavior will allow the sales team to be a self-contained
hierarchy; however, the end balance is transferred to the head office account for remittance.
3.3.4.43.4.4.4 BILL  CYCLE MANAGEMENT
Running  and managing  bill cycles efficiently is critical in ensuring:
• Customers are issued invoices in a timely fashion.
• Customers are not missed from bill processing, and
• The bills issued are correct and complete.
To achieve this, Encompass supports several billing process options.  These are:
• Standard Bill Run: generates invoices as part of a standard periodic bill cycle.

Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems
International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 108 of 169

• Quality Assurance (QA) Bill Run: These allow a sample of customers to be test billed i.e. it
generates test invoices which are not sent to the customer and are not payable. This process
steps through  the standard billing  process using a duplicate set of actual charges to test all
the relevant charging components  for errors.

Figure 46: Bill Run Types

The bill run process consists of a number of bill run steps. These steps are:
• Generate recurring adjustments,  due to retrospective changes made to a charge billed in
advance.
• Generate recurring charges.
• Calculate the bill.
• Generate the bill file.
• Apply the invoice to the account.
• Allocate the invoice amount  against any outstanding  credits.
• Print the bill file.
The bill run steps are executed in an ordered sequence from a specified step to another specified step for
each customer hierarchy. This allows, for example, for an invoice file to be generated, but  not applied to
the account, allowing for the checking  of invoice contents prior to updating  the customer account balance.
Each of these bill run steps are performed on all the customer hierarchies that have been assigned to the
bill cycle being run as of the bill cycle effective date. A customer is assigned to a specific bill cycle during
customer creation.
Billing operations staff can manage the bill process in the following  ways:
• Specify additional  conditions  or invoice suppression to exclude customers from a bill run.
• Specify how many customer hierarchies to push through  the bill run steps simultaneously.
• Specify how many bill run errors are allowed before Encompass aborts the bill run.
• Specify how many batches to process in parallel.
• Revoke selected bill run steps or all bill run steps for either a single customer hierarchy or an
entire bill run. Encompass will then reverse the impacts of these steps and allow the bill run
steps to be re-executed. This can be used if billing issues are detected.

FIGURE 47:  B&A–STUDIO - BILL  RUNS VIEW

Encompass’s provides a resource control mechanism that can be used to prevent operations staff from
initiating  bill runs during critical load hours that consume too many system resources or to pro-actively
stop bill runs that run longer than the available operation window.
Encompass also keeps a detailed audit trail of all bill run activities performed on each customer included in
the bill run (i.e. when  each step was performed and how  long it took) and tracks statistics of each bill run
step (i.e. the number of customers processed by each step and the billed value of generated invoices). This
allows the bill run to be monitored  and ensures the completeness of the bill run.
Encompass allows individual  customer hierarchies to be suppressed or skipped from inclusion in a bill run.
A customer hierarchy can be manually marked to be suppressed for a period, or business rules can be
defined to automate the suppression.  A customer whose billing  is suppressed is equivalent to a customer
which was never billed.  Suppression can be useful for customers who  regularly trigger a bill run failure
and thus need manual intervention,  or to skip billing  customers whose account is in credit. By default, all
customers are billed during  a bill run.
3.3.4.53.4.4.5 TAX CALCULATION
Encompass supports the standard taxation models of Harmonized Sales Tax and Goods and Service Tax
(GST). HST/GST/PST/RST/QST style taxation is applied to all transactions that can include a tax burden.
These transactions include:
• All invoiceable charges including  one-off, recurring and usage charges.
• Account adjustments.
Taxation liability is reported to the General Ledger on the issue of an invoice. Therefore, tax is only liable
once billed.
The following  rules apply to the generation of tax charges:
• Each individual  charge relates to a specific tax category. The category defines the fixed
percentage tax rate to apply. This category is determined at the time the charge is generated
within Encompass (i.e. it could be during  rating or billing).
Commented [CH17]: Clarify that it is Canadian taxes as
there are more than just GST and HST.

International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 110 of 169

• If the percentage tax rate for a category is set to 0, the charges that use that category are
considered tax-free.
• Each charge generated by Encompass will include the taxable amount  within  that charge i.e.
the charge is tax inclusive. The tax component  of each charge will be stored on the charge
record, as well as in the General Ledger (for financial reporting).
• Tax exemption  can be defined for a type of event (e.g. emergency calls), for a specific
customer, and for all customers of a specified customer type (e.g. charity organizations).
• In the case where multiple tax exemption  levels may apply, the order of priority  for
determining  the tax category is: i) event type exemption,  ii) individual  customer exemption,
and iii) customer type exemption.
• Any discounts  that are applied during  the bill run will also apply the proportionate  discounts
to applicable taxes. This discount will be applied based on the tax category of the charges
being discounted.
• Invoice and statement charges are shown as tax exclusive amounts.  The total tax charge
components  for all tax rates are shown as a separate line item in the invoice details section of
the invoice.
• All tax amounts are rounded up to the maximum  number of decimal places supported by the
account currency (CAD).
All tax amounts are reported to the GL via a tax liability account.  Tax amounts are always treated as
Actuals (i.e. Billed and Earned).
3.3.4.5.13.4.4.5.1 TAX ON PREPAID
Prepaid taxes are collected at the time of voucher top-up  or through preauthorized payment for registered
customers.  The pre-tax portion  of the payment amount  is recorded against the prepaid liability account of
the customer.  Usage and/or recurring charges are reflected against the prepaid account, effectively
reducing the prepaid liability.
Tax portion  of payment is reported against the tax liability for the applicable jurisdiction.
3.3.53.4.5 BILL INQUIRY, DISPUTE AND ADJUSTMENT
3.3.5.13.4.5.1 BILL INQUIRY
Billing enquiry is one of the most common call center requests. It is vital that the user is provided  with
detailed billing information to resolve the customer’s requests. Encompass billing enquiry  is designed to
give a complete picture of the financial status of a customer account and supports activities described in
this section. So, it acts more as an ‘Account enquiry’ capability rather than being limited to just post-billing
activities.

To assist with balance related enquiries, Encompass lists all accounts the customer may have with the
following  information:
• Account Type & Number.
• Current Balance and Current Balance Date.
• Unbilled Amount.
• Disputed Amount.
Information  on the number  of months  the primary account is outstanding  (aging balance) is also provided.
3.3.5.1.23.4.5.1.2 ACCOUNT ACTIVITY
A list of the most recent account activities such as payments, adjustments,  disputes and invoices are
displayed by default.  Details of the account activity will be displayed when selected by the user.
The activities retrieved can be filtered using  a combination  of activity dates, reference number and/or
activity type entered by the user. For ease of viewing, activities are paginated and ordered by the activity
date showing  the most recent first.

3.3.5.1.33.4.5.1.3 CHARGE DETAILS
Upon receiving the invoice, the customer may want to enquire about the charge amount  for usages
included on the invoice. To answer these types of requests, the user needs visibility on the charge details
of the invoice. The Invoices and Statements Tab shows a list of invoices and statements and can be filtered
based on date, type of invoice (invoice or statement) and the service.

A history of Invoice Transactions is provided showing  ID, the Service, Date, Type (e.g., Recurring), Amount
and Disputed Amount. This can be filtered by date.

FIGURE 52:  BILLING –NQUIRY - INVOICE  CHARGES  DETAILS  AND SUMMARIES  EXAMPLE

3.3.5.1.43.4.5.1.4 MISSING PAYMENT
In situations where a customer payment cannot be found  further investigation  may be required. By setting
the flag to report a missing payment the user is prompted  to enter details of the missing payment
(payment type, date and reference number) required for the investigation. Encompass will automatically
create a task assigned to the appropriate  work group to follow up with the missing payment request.
3.3.5.1.53.4.5.1.5 INVOICE/STATEMENT VIEWING
At times, it may be easier for the user to look at the customer’s invoice (or statement) image to understand
the customer’s query. For example, if the customer is asking a question like “What is the charge at the
bottom of page 3 of my invoice for” then viewing  the image can speed up the process of answering this
query. Encompass also tags each charge displayed on an invoice with a unique  item number  which, if
printed into  the image, can be used as an alternative reference that the user can use via the standard
billing  enquiry screen to also answer this style of question.
The Customer Connect Billing Dashboard provided the Account actions, a view of transactions & unbilled
usage, option  to view invoices and statements and the option  to print an invoice.
3.3.5.1.63.4.5.1.6 VIEWING ENTITLEMENTS (ALLOWANCES OR FREE UNITS)
Customer Connect provides a view of allowances and entitlement for users to fetch entitlement  details for
a customer. Filters are provided to refine the entitlements returned at a date specified by the user. The
entitlement  details displayed varies depending on the type of entitlement  being retrieved however the
associated Product Offer, Expiry Date and Expiry Status will be available for all.

FIGURE 53: VIEWING  ALLOWANCE  AND ENTITLEMENTS

3.3.5.23.4.5.2 ADJUSTMENTS
Freedom requires the ability to adjust a customer’s account easily and efficiently to reduce churn, maintain
customer loyalty and meet service level agreements. For example, a customer may have concerns about
the invoiced amount or the level of the service they received from Freedom.  As a result, Freedom may
wish to grant a credit adjustment to retain the customer’s business.
In Encompass, adjustments can be entered directly by the user and represent debit or credit movement of
the customer’s account balance. Each adjustment requires a reason code to be recorded.  This can be used
for reporting  purposes. For postpaid accounts, Encompass’s standard behavior is to apply credit
adjustments to the oldest invoice first. A user with the required level of security access can change the
credit adjustment  allocation if required.
The adjustment  types that can be initiated  by the user are defined in Table 26Table 26 below.

TABLE 26: USER INITIATED ADJUSTMENT TYPES
ADJUSTMENT
TYPE
DESCRIPTION
Miscellaneous
Credit
A generic credit adjustment which can be used for situations where a
goodwill  credit is required to be granted.
Debt Transfer
Used to transfer debt from one customer to another.  The customers
transferring from and to must belong to the same hierarchy.
Account Penalty
A debit adjustment which  can be used in situations where manual
account penalty needs to be applied.

Page 116 of 169

Encompass regulates the maximum adjustment  amount  a user can grant. This control is based on the
adjustment  limit associated with the security profile assigned to the user. Adjustments  entered by the user
with an amount lower than their profile’s adjustment limit are automatically accepted by the Encompass
while adjustments with amount greater than the user’s profile adjustment limit are restricted from being
created.
3.3.5.2.13.4.5.2.1 BULK ADJUSTMENT LOAD
Encompass provides a batch interface that allows bulk  loading of adjustments. Freedom can use this
loader to apply adjustments against a defined set of customer accounts for business needs.  For example,
to provide a goodwill  credit to a set of customers who experienced service disruption.
The loader supports  adjustment details in CSV, ASCII formatted files. Each record will be processed
sequentially and validated to ensure attribute  values supplied are valid values in Encompass. The table
below lists the details required.
TABLE 27: BULK ADJUSTMENT LOAD
ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
Bulk Adjustment Load
Adjustments can be created with the input  file containing  the
following  attributes:
• Adjustment  Type,
• Description,
• Account Identifier,
• Currency,
• Amount,
• Adjustment  Date,
• Reason and
• Invoice Number (optional)
Adjustment  amount will be applied against the account if an
Invoice Number is not supplied.

3.3.5.33.4.5.3 DISPUTE MANAGEMENT
Customer may raise billing disputes with Freedom. Encompass dispute functionality  includes dispute
creation and dispute resolution  including  both  accepting and rejecting disputes. The standard behavior of
Encompass defaults the charge amount of the charge being  disputed as the dispute amount.  A predefined
list of dispute reasons is provided which  can be set by the Agent accordingly.
When a dispute is accepted, an adjustment is created awarding the total or partial dispute amount to
offset the customer’s amount owing.
The amount being disputed will be considered when calculating the available credit for the customer’s
account. The criteria for entering  or exiting  collections will also consider amounts in dispute.

3.3.5.3.13.4.5.3.1 CHARGE LEVEL DISPUTE BILLABLE AMOUNT
Encompass provides the capability to assign a dispute  at the charge level. The default behavior is to set the
charge amount  of the charge being disputed  as the dispute amount.  There may however be cases where
the charge amount is not the true billable amount  for a charge. For example, a tax excluded charge will
incur a different billable amount when tax is applied
3.3.5.3.23.4.5.3.2 DISPUTE CREATION AND WORKFLOW
Customer Connect presents all billing information for a customer’s services in easy to access and navigate
screens. This streamlines the billing  inquiry  activities.

FIGURE 54:BILLING  OVERVIEW  SCREEN  PROVIDES  A SUMMARY  FOR  HANDLING  A DISPUTE

However, there are times when the customer is not satisfied, and a dispute is raised with  the potential  for
adjustments to be made to the account.
Customer Connect provides dedicated screens to guide the Agent through  handling  disputes and
adjustments to ensure that you are tracking each stage, and to ensure that your policies and processes
are executed. Customer Connect standard dispute  and adjustment  screens will be used for Freedom.
3.3.63.4.6 TRANSACTIONAL DOCUMENT PRODUCTION
CSG Encompass provides:
• An invoice generation process (IGP) to generate invoices, statements and collection/treatment
letters to be created for the customers.  These are generated in XML or PDF format,
• A file transfer mechanism to transfer the generated XML-formatted documents  to a
formatting/rendering  application.
CSG Encompass allows different invoice formats to be defined for invoices and statements, if desired, with
the user being able to associate 1 or more formats with  each customer account.  CSG Encompass will then
automatically generate the documents in XML format, as part of each bill run, tagging  each document with
the required invoice format

3.3.6.13.4.6.1 XML INVOICES
Encompass generates XML invoices to produce the end document.  The XML data is supplied  in UTF-8
encoding.  This format does not imply any layout of the resulting rendered document image.  It includes all
the dynamic data used for inclusion on the rendered image, and control  information  that can be used by
the third-party rendering  system.

FIGURE 55:  XML INVOICE  CREATION  PROCESS

The XML document  for invoices and statements distinguishes  between an invoice and a statement via an
XML element that indicates whether the information  is invoice information  (and therefore payable) or
statement information  (and therefore for information  purposes only). The invoice and statement XML files
conform to a specific XML schema.  This XML document  contains information  relating to the following:

3.3.6.23.4.6.2 PDF INVOICE XSLT
Encompass generates all invoices as XML files and ensures the necessary invoice information  is present in
the invoice XML file. Encompass produces one XML file format (XML schema) for all invoices, regardless of
the final invoice PDF format.
Encompass uses XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) to convert the XML generated
customer invoices files into the required invoice PDF file. The XSLT files are deployed into Encompass so
that Encompass may generate the invoice PDF files in the correct format.
CSG will configure the initial PDF invoice layout. The solution  will provide a single PDF invoice format.  PDF
invoices will be transferred to the PDF Server for customer delivery/viewing.
It is Freedom’s responsibility to create and maintain the XLST files for each required invoice PDF template.
A drag-and-drop  XSLT generation desktop application (such as Altova Stylevision) may be used to create
and maintain the invoice PDF template XSLT files. Freedom will be responsible for procuring  and licensing
any additional  formatting  tools such as Altova Stylevision.

3.3.6.33.4.6.3 PRINT READY INVOICE
Encompass generates a print ready invoice in PDF format that can be used for mailing invoices to the
customers.
Invoice images can be generated using the customer’s preferred language although the solution provided
only includes invoice generation  in one language (English). Similarly, the solution  includes configuration
for only one invoice layout definition. In order to reduce the impact on Freedom’s existing customers CSG
will consider the existing invoice format when designing  the new solution;  however, due to potential
differences between the existing and the new solution there will likely be unavoidable  differences in the
invoice format.
By default, Encompass uses Helvetica font for the document  and must use one of the base Type 1 fonts
supported  natively by PDF.
The invoice layout contains the following information:
• First Page:

o Customer contact information  i.e. name and address.
o Service provider logo.
o Invoice number and invoice date.
o Summary bar that includes totals for:
▪ Payments in the period.
▪ Adjustments.
▪ 4 configurable  charge summaries for example, total recurring charges, total taxes,
total usage charges, and total one-time charges.
o Variable image area is a reserved section of the first page of the invoice. A graphic image
with embedded  text describing special offers or other marketing messages. Images are
maintained in the EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format.
o Variable text area to include the marketing messages.
o Billable secondary account information,  for example deposit or loyalty account
information.
▪ Account type, account number, and account balance.
o Remittance section:
▪ Address of the service provider where the remittance slip is mailed.
▪ Includes one payment type based configurable  message to indicate date on which
the payment is due by.
▪ OCR line to support optical reading of payment slips.
• Second page includes the section for “Ways to Pay”. This section occupies the upper portion of
the page above the perforated line separating the rest of the page from the remittance slip.
• Detail pages are generated for each node in the hierarchy of the customer.
o Customer hierarchy information  i.e. details of all accounts contributing  to this invoice.
o Customer hierarchy charge summary i.e. a summary of all charges for each child
customer.
o Customer hierarchy charge details i.e. any charges charged directly to the account, for
example, discounts.
o Free unit lists: List of summaries of the customer level included entitlements.
o Tab and TradeUp section where applicable.
o Service summary for each of the postpaid services
▪ Formatting  of the charges is dependent  on the type of service.
o Summary of usage charges by type of usage.
▪ Free unit list: List of summaries of service level included entitlements.
▪ Usage charges for the services, separated by the type of usage, for example,
roaming and long distance. Usage charges for the services are included in the
invoice if a detailed invoice is requested by the customer.

3.3.6.43.4.6.4 TREATMENT LETTERS
The solution  will leverage the existing implementation  process of creating a batch CSV file that is sent to
the print vendor for rendering and distribution  to the end customer.
3.3.6.53.4.6.5 DOCUMENT LANGUAGE
The XML-formatted documents contain a parameter to indicate the preferred language of the customer
although  the solution being provided only includes one language (English). All XML invoice data output
from CSG Encompass will be in the same language it is entered into the CSG Encompass Database.
3.3.6.63.4.6.6 DOCUMENT DELIVERY
Encompass will support  an interface to Freedom’s PDF Server for printing  and/or delivery to the end
subscriber.
Encompass generates invoices in PDF format for postpaid bill cycles.  For those customers who  have opted
for printed  invoices, Encompass will place them in a designated directory on the PDF Server.  Similarly, for
all other customers, Encompass will place them in a separate directory on the PDF Server.  It is expected
that Freedom will manage the distribution  of invoices for printing  to the print vendor,  and for viewing of
invoices to the end subscribers.
The existing directory structure and naming conventions on the PDF server will be maintained to minimize
impact on other applications.
3.3.6.73.4.6.7 INVOICE  MESSAGES
Encompass allows invoice messages to be set up that are conditional  on customer account information.
An invoice message is eligible based on:
• The date range that the invoice is effective in e.g. a message for inclusion  in the period before
a religious holiday.
• Invoice attributes e.g. if the invoice is over a certain amount.
• Account attributes e.g. the account has an outstanding  balance.
• Customer attributes  e.g. if the primary contact for the account is having a birthday in the next
bill period.
Fixed text invoice messages can be included  for printing  on the invoice. Any number of invoice messages
may be eligible for inclusion on the invoice and no priority order is implied by each message.
As standard, Encompass solution includes the following  five (5) invoice message types:
• Invoice overdue.
• Auto-pay Registration Confirmation.
• Auto-pay Confirmation  i.e. this invoice will be auto-paid.
• Auto-pay Detail Change Confirmation.
• Auto-pay Credit Card Expiry Warning.

3.3.6.83.4.6.8 CRITICAL INFORMATION  SUMMARY (CIS)
The external document management system (DMS) will hold the contract template, generate the contract
document,  support  signing, and storage. To support document  generation Encompass will integrate to
send customer and product information  to DMS.  The link to the document  will be sent back to Encompass
for agent access. Freedom will be responsible for creating and maintaining  the CIS templates and the
associated versions.
3.3.73.4.7 POSTPAID COLLECTION MANAGEMENT
3.3.7.13.4.7.1 POLICY DEFINITION
The solution  allows for the definition  of configurable  workflows to recover overdue debt from customers.
A set of collection flows (known  in Encompass as treatment paths) can be configured,  each specifying a
sequence of steps to be undertaken,  as well as the time duration between the invocation  of each step.
Steps can be either automatic or manual. Manual steps can be assigned to specific work groups to
execute.

FIGURE 56:  COLLECTIONS  OVERVIEW

Collection rules are used to determine whether customers with  overdue debt should  enter the collections
process based on a combination  of customer attributes (customer type and credit class), amount owing,
and age of debt – and if so, the collections strategy to which  they should  be assigned.
3.3.7.1.13.4.7.1.1 COLLECTION FLOW CREATION
Encompass supports the definition  of configurable collection workflows,  also known  as treatment paths.
Each collection workflow  comprises a series of steps. Each step within  a collection’s workflow  defines:
• The collection action to be undertaken and its sequence within  the workflow.
• Supported  collections actions are:
o Customer contact, i.e. phone call.
o Collections letter.
o SMS message.

o Product  suspension.
o External Debt Collection - During this step, the Service Provider will pass the treatment
customer to an external debt collection agency to manage customer debt collection.
Therefore, a ’customer’s details would only  be extracted once while the customer is
currently in treatment and at the time that the customer has entered the 'External
Collection’ Agency' step. This extract file will include customer contact and address
details, customer current financial status and agency assignment details.
• The workforce responsible for implementing  the action, where applicable.
• The number of days until the next action becomes due.
3.3.7.1.23.4.7.1.2 COLLECTION RULES DEFINITION
Customers will enter or exit the collections process based on:
• Overdue debt - debt amounts will be calculated as excluding  open disputed  amounts and
unallocated payments or adjustments.  Whether or not a customer will enter the collections
process will be based on a combination  of the following  attributes:
o Customer type, e.g. consumer or business.
o Credit class.
o Overdue amount.
o Overdue period.
• If it is found  that the customer should enter the collections process, the selected collections
strategy to be followed will be based on a combination  of the following  attributes:
o Customer type.
o Credit class.
• Credit limit breach – current debt will be calculated as excluding any unallocated  payments or
adjustments.
Specific customers may be explicitly flagged as being exempt from the collections process. If a customer is
flagged as exempt, they will not  enter the collections process even if the normal collections entry criteria
have been met.
3.3.7.23.4.7.2 POLICY EXECUTION
The solution  supports the execution and management of collections processes associated with customer
accounts that have overdue debt.  The following  functionality  is provided  by the solution:
• Determination of the collection treatment policy to be assigned to a customer account that
has overdue debt or that has breached their credit limit.
• Implementation  of a set of debt recovery activities according to the chosen collection policy.
These activities may include financial penalties, service restrictions or disconnections,
customer communications  (automatic or manual), or a write-off of the debt (and potential
transfer of the debt to an external collection agency).
• Monitoring  of events that may impact the collection execution  path, such as: customer
payments or adjustments,  creation or update of disputes, updates to customer details.
• The ability for collections agents to override the automated  collections flow in order to pause,
slow down,  or speed up the execution of collection treatments, or to report on customers
within  the collections process.

Each of these areas is described in more detail below.
3.3.7.2.13.4.7.2.1 COLLECTION DECISION ENGINE
A customer may enter the collections process as a result of overdue debt,  or because they have breached
their credit limit. Certain customers or customer types may be excluded from the collections process.
The collection treatment policy that will be assigned to the customer entering  the collections process will
be based on:
• Customer type.
• Credit class.

FIGURE 57:  TREATMENT PROGRESSION  STEPS  PER CUSTOMER  TYPE/CREDIT  CLASS

3.3.7.2.23.4.7.2.2 COLLECTION TREATMENT MANAGEMENT
For a customer undergoing  a collection treatment, a treatment monitor process verifies and executes a set
of debt recovery activities on their assigned due dates, according to the chosen collection policy. The
following  activities may be applied:
• Customer contact, i.e. phone call – creates an action for a collections agent to manually call
the customer on a specific date.
• Collections Letter – generate an XML document  representing the dynamic content  of a
collections letter and submit for processing.
• SMS Message – sends a reminder SMS message to the customer.
• Product  Suspension – suspend all products associated with the customer, including  products
attached to non-invoice  child accounts. For provisionable  products, this update will trigger
workflow  to perform a network suspension of the affected products.
• Automatically  cancel  the ’customer’s market  offer  instances  for  which  it  is  responsible  for
paying  (i.e., this may include  market offer instances of any child  accounts that  do not  receive
their own invoice).
• Set the customer account status to be 'Legal actioned'.

• No longer generate future customer invoices once the customer account is written off and the
Total Overdue Amount  Owing is zero.
Else if the outstanding  amount  is greater than the threshold  value then Encompass will:
• Automatically create a 'Treatment Manual Review’ action and assign it to the AR Collections
department,  where they  will  be  able to  make a manual  decision  on  whether  to  write  off  the
balance or not.
• The customer treatment  progression will  be paused while  the AR Collections department  are
investigating  the issue.
Once the Account Receivable team is assigned the 'Treatment Manual Review’ action, then they will attempt
to contact  the customer to  recoup the  outstanding  debt.  If they succeed, then  they may receive sufficient
funds for the customer to exit treatment or set up a payment plan.
When  the  Account  Receivable  team closes the  'Treatment  Manual  Review’  action  then  Encompass  will
determine if:
• The customer account is still in Treatment and on the write off treatment step.
• The customer is not Treatment Exempt.
• The customer does not have an open Payment Plan.
Then, this  would  imply  that the  customer has not paid  its outstanding  debt  nor made any provision  to do
so, therefore Encompass will proceed to:
• Automatically  cancel  the customer’s market  offer  instances  for  which  they  are  responsible  for
paying  (i.e., this may include market offer instances of any child accounts that do not  receive their
own invoice).
3.3.7.2.33.4.7.2.3 COLLECTION EXECUTION MONITORING
The following  events are monitored and acted upon in order to determine their impact upon  the execution
of a customer’s collection policy:
• Events impacting the customer’s account balance:
o Invoice processing.
o Payment processing, including  payment rejections.
o Adjustment  processing.
o Invoice dispute processing.
• Events impacting  customer data:
o Changes to customer credit limit.
Detection of any of these event types will result in a re-evaluation of the customer’s progression through
their current collections path.
If a customer exits the collections process, for example as a result of a payment being applied, it may be
necessary to undo previous treatment management activities. For example: unsuspending any products
that were previously suspended. Unsuspending products previously suspended during  collections are
automatically handled by the solution.
3.3.7.2.43.4.7.2.4 MANUAL INTERVENTION
A collections agent may search for and easily retrieve details of customers undergoing  a collections
treatment, or customers with open invoice disputes or promises to pay.

Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems
International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 127 of 169

In addition,  a collections agent will have the ability to manually override the automated  collections flow
associated with a customer undergoing  a collections treatment. The following  actions are supported:
• Change the date that the next collections activity becomes due.
• Skip over a particular step in the collection workflow.
• Suspend (or un-suspend) the collection workflow  activity.
For each step in the collection process, the collections agent may manually add their own notes.
3.3.7.33.4.7.3 SETTLEMENT
The collections solution allows a collections agent to negotiate with  a customer and offer them acceptable
plans to pay off their outstanding  debts. Within Encompass, this payment plan is known as a “Promise-ToPay” and allows for the definition of a payment plan and monitoring against that plan.
3.3.7.3.13.4.7.3.1 BUILD PAYMENT PLAN
Based upon negotiation  with  the customer, a collections agent may negotiate a Promise-To-Pay. The
information  collected against the promise is:
• The total promised amount – must be enough to enable the customer to exit the collection
process.
• The number of instalments.
• The instalment period (e.g. weekly).
• The promise start date.
The promise may be created before a customer is being managed by the collection process. This will not
prevent the customer entering the collection process, but it will prevent any collection activity being
undertaken  whilst the promise is open or is being kept.
Only a single active Promise-To-Pay can exist for a given customer at any point in time.
3.3.7.3.23.4.7.3.2 MONITOR PAYMENT PLAN
Creation of a new Promise-To-Pay will suspend any current collections activity for the customer during  the
period within  which the Promise is open or is being kept.
A monitor process will run on the instalment  due date to determine whether  the promise to pay
instalment has been kept or broken.  If the promise is broken,  the collection process will immediately
resume and anyat the next collection activity that was due to have occurred before the promise was
broken will be executed immediately. If the promise is kept, collection activity will remain suspended.
When all instalments associated with the promise have been made, the customer will exit the collection
process.
3.3.83.4.8 RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT
3.3.8.13.4.8.1 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MANAGEMENT
As a customer with an asset account utilizes a service, the customer may accumulate debt to the service
provider. The service provider tracks the amount  of debt by maintaining  an account for the customer in
the accounting system. Customer balances are affected by financial transactions like invoices, payments
and adjustments. Encompass supports “balance forward accounting” for management of the receivables.

Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems
International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 128 of 169

Balance forward accounting  combines the previous unpaid  invoice amount with  the current balance and
refers to this total as the current amount due. Therefore, there is only ever one outstanding  invoice in a
balance forward environment  (that is, the current invoice) and individual  aged amounts  (from previous
invoices) do not appear on the current invoice as they are rolled forward into  the current period.
In balance forward accounting, Encompass tracks the customer account balances. The payments,
adjustments and invoices affect the balance of the customer’s account. The customers do not see details of
which invoices they have paid and which ones they have not.
Internally, the age of the debt for each invoice is tracked for collection/treatment and reporting  purposes.
Outstanding  debt is classified by default into aging band– of:
• 0 - 30 –days
• 31 - 60 –days
• 61 - 90 days
• 90 days
The classification of aging bands can be customized on an account type basis.
The days are offset from the payment due date for an invoice. A customer may have multiple  outstanding
invoices and thus have debt in multiple ageing bands. Payments and adjustment offset the oldest
outstanding  item.
3.3.8.23.4.8.2 JOURNALIZATION
Encompass functions  as an account receivable sub-ledger. Encompass maintains the accounts of
customers and stores records of the transactions that affect the balances of these accounts. Transactions
include invoices, payments and adjustments.  These financial transactions also affect general ledger
accounts. Encompass supports reporting  to an external General Ledger (GL) system the effects of the
transactions on General Ledger accounts.

Encompass provides support  for journalization of postpaid  and prepaid line of businesses through  the
following  functionality.
3.3.8.2.13.4.8.2.1 MAINTAIN GL ACCOUNTS
Encompass will be configured  to maintain accounting  books for Freedom business entity. GL accounts will
be maintained  for Postpaid and Prepaid lines of businesses.
Encompass maintains a subset of the general ledger chart of accounts for an accounting  book. Encompass
supports the following  types of GL accounts:
• Cash.
• Account receivable.
• Tax Liability.
• Prepaid credit.
• Accounts payable.
• Revenue.
• Expenses.
GL accounts can be alphanumeric up to a maximum of 64 single byte characters.
Linear time-based revenue recognition  is supported.
3.3.8.2.23.4.8.2.2 GL ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENT
Encompass supports fine-grained  GL reporting by enabling GL accounts to be derived for every
transaction that has a financial impact. Encompass associates multiple pairs of GL Accounts to every
charge, payment and adjustment  entered in the system.
3.3.8.2.2.13.4.8.2.2.1 Charges
Each charge component  (which, for example, may include a base price, discount  and surcharge) calculated
for a usage or recurring event is associated with a pair of GL accounts. Discrepancies can occur at a
summary level because of different rounding  scales for individual  components and the overall final
charge. These discrepancies are also associated with a pair of GL accounts. The charge component  is
treated using  one of the four different financial categories as per Table 29Table 29 below.

TABLE 29: CHARGE FINANCIAL CATEGORIES
FINANCIAL CATEGORY NOTES
Accrual
Earned but unbilled  (EBUB) becomes billed and Earned (BE)
when invoiced.  Can be used for postpaid usage charges,
recurring charges, one-time charges, etc.
Deferral
Billed but  unearned becomes billed and earned (BE) over time.
This category can be used for postpaid rental charges in
advance.
Actual
Billed and earned is the final state. This category can be used for
Tax charges also.

Page 130 of 169

Non-Billable
Earned but unbilled.  This category can be used for prepaid
usage charges and revenue/expense recognition.

Handling and reporting  of journal  entries for monthly  recurring charges, multi-month recurring charges,
Discounts, Payments, Connection fee (including  revenue recognition), Adjustments, one-off charges
(including  One Time Pass) and taxes are included in the solution.
3.3.8.2.2.23.4.8.2.2.2 Payments
The debit GL account (cash) for the payment transaction is determined based on the payment type. The
credit GL account (account receivable) for payments is determined  based on the receivable to which  the
payment is allocated.
If a payment rejection is performed in Encompass, the rejection reverses the effect of the original payment
on the GL accounts.
3.3.8.2.2.33.4.8.2.2.3 Adjustments
GL accounts for adjustments  are determined by the solution based on the attributes of the adjustment:
the adjustment type and adjustment reason code.
3.3.8.2.2.43.4.8.2.2.4 Load and Maintain GL Codes and Guidance
GL Codes and GL Guidance can be loaded in bulk to the company’s ledger structure using scheduled tasks
or the command line. In the event of small changes to the GL code or GL guidance entities, it is also
possible to make changes manually, so that changes can be viewed and verified immediately.
Using the Business & Administration  Studio, it is possible to load and maintain  GL codes and GL Guidance
data.
Business & Administration  Studio can import:
• General Ledger (GL) codes in bulk.
• General Ledger (GL) guidance entities in bulk.
Business & Administration  Studio offers the ability to update  the:
• GL guidance entities where users can update the GL guidance name, description, the
associated credit and debit GL code fields, and security group.
• GL code entities where users can update the GL code name, description,  Parent GL code,
reporting  entity, currency, account class, account category, and security group.

3.3.8.2.2.53.4.8.2.2.5 Tab Journal Entries
The solution  will generate journal entries during  initialization  (new sales or hardware upgrade), buyer’s
remorse, rate plan change, settlements, cancellations and migration  of Tab and TradeUp contracts (where
applicable).  These GL entries will be in-line with  existing Freedom functionality  in production.
For example:
New Tab setup will generate double-sided  GL entries for the following tab component  (where applicable):
• Subsidy
• Finance
• Upfront Payment
• ‘Upfront payment’ reversal for Dealers
3.3.8.2.33.4.8.2.3 SALES JOURNAL
Periodically, the financial information  is aggregated and posted to a sales journal in Encompass. Sales
journals summarize the financial transactions made within  a specific open accounting period for a set of
books.
The posting  to the sales journal will be performed on 1
st
 day of every month  for the previous month
(accounting period), and any period-based accrual or deferral charges, payments and adjustments are
handled effective at this date.
3.3.8.33.4.8.3 FINANCIAL REPORTING
Encompass provides the following  functionality  for reporting financial activities against customer
accounts.
3.3.8.3.13.4.8.3.1 GENERAL LEDGER EXTRACT
Transactions that affect the General Ledger (GL) are reported to an external GL system via the GL Upload
process. The process comprises of two phases as shown in the figure below.

Page 132 of 169

FIGURE 5960:  PHASES  OF  GL UPLOAD

Sales journal information  is extracted for use by a general ledger system. This information  is summarized
by reporting entity  (accounting book), accounting  period and GL code. The net movement of unposted
sales journal entries for a GL code is included  in a GL extract.
GL information  generated from the sales journal can be revoked if the file containing  the GL information
has not been transferred to the general ledger system.
If sales journal information  is revoked after uploading  to the GL, reversing entries are created instead to
reverse the effect of the original posting.
GL upload  files are generated as per the existing  CSV file format currently in production. The existing
functionality in Freedom’s Singleview solution will be leveraged where possible.GL upload files are written
into a file in a fixed directory on the file system.
Amounts included  in the CSV file extract can contain up to 3 decimal places. If the contributing  charges are
recorded to a higher number of decimal places, these amounts are aggregated (based on debit  and credit
GL) and rounded  to 3 decimal places during extraction  to the GL.
3.3.8.3.23.4.8.3.2 REPORTS
Encompass provides the following  financial reports that exist currently.
1. MBB Summary Postpaid MRC
2. MBB Summary Postpaid Usage
3. MBB Summary Prepaid Usage
4. Month End Accrual
5. Month End Deferral Postpaid MRC
6. Unbalance GL Tab Account

18. SIM Card Fee Adjustment Report
The above reports will be reviewed during  Definition  phase to assess any impacts for changes needed
related to the new solution.
3.3.8.43.4.8.4 PAYMENT MANAGEMENT
The timely entry of remittance information ensures the accuracy of a customer’s account balance and
supports several business processes, including:
• Treatment processing.
• Aged debt management.
• General ledger.
• Balance management.
The payment functionality  within Encompass facilitates the acceptance of payments through  a variety of
sources such as the Encompass GUI, real-time interfaces and file-based batch interfaces.
Payment Types
Encompass can be configured  to support different  types of payments, including:
• Cash
• cheque.
• Pre-authorized Credit cards and debit cards.
• Credit Card
• Telepin Voucher
• Top-up Tax
• Assisted Fee
Payment States
A payment in Encompass can have one of four states:
• Entered: the payment has been entered against a customer’s account, but has not been
applied to a customer’s balance (i.e. the balance has not yet been impacted)
• Applied: the payment has been applied to the customer’s balance.
• Rejected: the payment was previously applied to the customer’s balance, checks or credit card
chargebacks, and then rejected.
• Future dated: the payment has been entered for a future date and will be applied on the
payment effective date.
The types of payments supported  by the proposed solution  are described in the sections below.
Payment Allocations
CSG supports the automatic allocation of payments based on pre-defined business rules. The supported
rules are:

Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems
International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 134 of 169

• If invoice number to allocate the payment to is specified, then payment will be allocated to
the specified invoice up to the current due of the invoice
• If the invoice number to allocate the payment to is not specified, the payment allocates to the
oldest outstanding  invoice first.
3.3.8.4.13.4.8.4.1 AUTO-PAY
The auto-pay solution  creates automatic invoice payments in Encompass and generates files of payment
instructions  for sending  to banks or other financial institutions.  The auto-pay solution consists of:
• Customer registration  processing.
• Payment creation process.
• File generation  scripts.
The auto-pay solution  is shown in Figure 60Figure 61:

FIGURE 6061: AUTO-PAY  SOLUTION
3.3.8.4.1.13.4.8.4.1.1 Customer Registration Processing
The payment creation process will only process customers that are registered for auto-pay. There are
fields configured  on the Encompass customer to capture the customer’s auto-pay status (i.e. unregistered,
active or suspended) as well as the necessary auto-pay account details.
A customer registering or de-registering for auto-pay will have a message added to their invoice informing
them of their new auto-pay status.
3.3.8.4.1.23.4.8.4.1.2 Payment Creation Process
The payment creation process is responsible for the generation of Encompass payment records. When
run, this process will create payments for each customer registered for auto-pay with  an outstanding
invoice due within  a configurable  number of days from the processing date. Payments will be created for
the customer’s outstanding  balance, minus the value of any adjustments, open disputes or payments
created since the invoice was generated.
If the last two auto-pay payments for a customer have been rejected, then the auto-pay details for the
customer are suspended and no more invoices for that customer are automatically paid until the auto-pay
details are corrected, or the auto-pay status for the customer is returned to ‘active’.
3.3.8.4.23.4.8.4.2 CREDIT CARD PAYMENT
For the Freedom implementation,  tokenization  will be used to avoid storing  credit card information  in CSG
Encompass.  Credit card payments and credit card information  may be entered via the following  methods:

Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.Copyright © 2025 CSG Systems
International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

• Direct entry of credit card payments via the CSG Encompass GUI using stored token.
• Real-time payments via interfaces.
3.3.8.4.2.13.4.8.4.2.1 Direct Entry of Credit Card Payments
Credit card payments may be entered directly in the CSG Encompass UI, using a token provided by the
payment gateway in place of the PAN.  Once entered into CSG Encompass, an attempt will be made to
authorize the payment through the real-time interface with the payment gateway system via Sonic.
3.3.8.4.2.23.4.8.4.2.2 Real Time Payment Entry
CSG Encompass provides a real-time payment API for payment entries.
3.3.8.4.33.4.8.4.3 PAYMENT INTERFACE
Encompass supports several interfaces to:
• Load payment records from a third-party system.
• Extract payment records from Encompass for authorization and/or settlement.
The current Freedom interfaces for loading payments are shown in Figure 61Figure 62, the Encompass
solution will implement by leveraging these current interfaces.

FIGURE 6162: PAYMENT  LOADING  INTERFACES
3.3.8.4.43.4.8.4.4 UNIDENTIFIED PAYMENTS
A payment from a batch interface may be received by CSG Encompass with insufficient details to allow it to
be matched with a customer’s account. For example, the incoming payment record may have a missing or
incorrect account number.  These payments are stored in CSG Encompass’s internal ‘unidentified payment
account’ and the payment reported in the General Ledger.

A user with the appropriate authorization  can search for a payment in the unidentified  payment account
using payment-related details such as the payment receipt number, date, location or method  of payment.
When the payment is identified the user can transfer the payment to the correct customer account. This
automatically adjusts the GL reporting.
Unidentified Payments Report
CSG Encompass’s Unidentified Payments Report details all the unidentified payments including the receipt
number,  type of payment and payment amount.

3.4.1.23.5.1.2 RETAIL CUSTOMER SUPPORT
The proposed solution involves replacing CREATE as an activation system for Freedom corporate stores,
dealers, and national retailers allowing the retirement of CREATE through providing  equivalent business
functionality.   This replacement is not meant to be a like-for-like solution as some of the current business
processes may require modification. The functions  outlined  below, which are currently facilitated by
external systems through  integration,  will be utilized whenever feasible to support  CREATE processes.
• Customer lookup and Validation where the agent can look up and validate a customer’s personal
information  and their subscribed service in the system using one of the following  methods:
o By customer’s account number
o By customer’s MSISDN
o By name and postal code of the customer.
o OTP Validation
• New customer activation for an agent to onboard a new customer.
o Validate address   using   external   address   validation   application/system provided   by
Freedom.
o A Credit check is performed before selling a postpaid service whereas a credit check is not
required for selling a prepaid service.
o A postpaid    service    can    be    added    only    when    a    successful    credit    check    is
returned.  Otherwise,  only prepaid service is offered.

that are currently  available to the customer.  Some of the promotions  require entering a
promotional code before the promotion can be applied to the customer’s account.
3.53.6 USAGE MANAGEMENT
Intermediate is already in use at Freedom, the Encompass solution  will leverage the current
implementation  with  no or limited changes. No changes or new implementations  are being proposed
concerning CSG Intermediate. Intermediate will no longer send roaming records to Encompass for the
rating of roaming agreements as the assumption  is that Interconnect will be performing  this functionality
going  forward. Encompass is responsible for online-based charging,  and it is assumed that all network
related events for rating, billing,  and invoicing are received through Commerce Engine as they are today.
CSG understands that there are non-customer impacting  events from the GW_EVENT event source that are
being sent to Singleview in the current solution.  Ideally the new solution  would no longer be sent these
events and Intermediate could be completely decoupled  from Encompass solution.   Freedom will need to
determine if these events are still required to be stored in the Encompass database or if there is a better
solution. CSG’s recommendation is that since it appears that these events do not impact the customer
from a billing perspective that they no longer be sent to Encompass.
However, CSG Intermediate remains essential for roaming purposes in collaboration with the Interconnect
module, operating  independently  of Encompass.

3.5.13.6.1 OUTBOUND ROAMING
Online roaming charging will be supported  through  the CAMEL framework for real-time charging.  This
ensures that all outbound roaming services, including  voice, SMS, and data, are authorized and charged
instantly through  the home network's Online  Charging System (OCS), providing greater transparency and
real-time balance management. The responsibility  for Partner Rating for roaming services will no longer
be managed within  the Encompass solution.  This includes all tasks related to calculating wholesale
roaming charges for partner networks,  applying  agreed-upon tariffs, and processing rating details.
It is important to note that there is a separate Interconnect solution  designated for partner settlement,
and the expectation  is that this system will be enabled to support roaming  agreements prior to
Encompass going  live. This is critical because, as mentioned, the new Encompass stack will not support
managing  partner roaming agreements within  its framework.
3.63.7 ENTERPRISE
3.6.13.7.1 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
3.6.1.13.7.1.1 SUPPORT  DATA WAREHOUSE
The Data Warehouse/Business Intelligence team will require access to the source Encompass billing  and
customer management data to support their business intelligence and reporting  capability. Typically, this
team requires the information  to be refreshed on a daily basis.
Data that is required for reporting  purposes or for extraction to a Data Warehouse is recommended to be
pulled from a dedicated reporting Encompass database which  is replicated from the production
Encompass database.
The proposed solution  addresses these requirements as follows:
• A business copy of Encompass will be used as the source of information  for the Data
Warehouse/Business Intelligence team.
• The data from the production  instance will be replicated into the business copy, on an agreed
frequency per day.
• The data warehouse and reporting operations will be executed on the business copy (i.e. the
replicated data of the production  instance).
• CSG will set up and provision the Encompass Business Copy using Oracle Data Guard (or
equivalent)
• CSG will provide 15 person days of guidance on the Encompass data model to enable the data
warehouse team and reporting  team on the rating, charging and billing  part of the BSS
solution.
For real-time replication, there is the Oracle Active Data Guard option.  There is an additional cost for using
active data guard (no cost with a SV+ license). This requirement may be addressed at a later point  in the
program, based on business justification.

3.6.23.7.2 SECURITY MANAGEMENT
3.6.2.13.7.2.1 CSG  SECURITY OVERVIEW
CSG is committed to providing  our clients with the most reliable, effective, and innovative  security
solutions available, which is led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and driven by CSG’s
management team. The model leverages PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST, and is based on the
internationally  accepted ISO 27001:2013 security framework.
The security model is centered on people, technology,  and process across the entire CSG organization and
is governed across three inter-locking  principles People, Technology and Processes as outlined below.

FIGURE 6263:  THREE INTERLOCKING SECURITY PRINCIPLES

3.6.2.23.7.2.2 ENCOMPASS  SECURITY
Security controls exist to protect the confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability of the entire solution,  and
the data that is stored, processed, and transmitted  by the solution.   The design and selection of the
security controls is informed  by generally accepted global standards (ISO 27001:2013, NIST 800-53),
consensus best practice (CIS CSC), Supplier policy and standards and requirements gathered from the
customer through  iterative design workshops.
The Security Controls align to the following  high-level  categories: Identity and Access Management,
Auditing  and Logging,  Asset and Configuration  Management, Application  Security, Data Security, Server
and Operating System Security, Network Security, and Cloud Security (where applicable).  The order,
organization,  and structure of this content  is intentional,  to describe these security controls in logical
groupings.   Principles described first (ex: Identity  and Access Management) can be assumed to apply
broadly across following  topics (ex: Application  Security, Server and Operating  System).

FIGURE 6364:  HIGH  LEVEL SECURITY CATEGORIES

Security provides the measures and controls employed to protect data and computing  resources from
unauthorized  access, misuse, disclosure, or corruption. The Encompass security capabilities are organised
into the following categories.

FIGURE 6465:  ENCOMPASS SECURITY CATEGORIES

• Identity  and Access Management: CSG deploys leading Identity  and Access Management
technologies to automate and streamline centralized Identity  management for employees
and contractors.
• Authentication:  The process of identifying  an individual  (or integrated  system) to confirm they
are whom they say they are.
• Authorization:  The process of granting  or denying  access to system resources (for example,
data, functions, technologies)  and limiting  operations to only those required for an
individual/system to do their job. See section 3.7.2.43.6.2.4 for more information.

Page 142 of 169

• Audit: The process of storing information  about user/system access and recording
information  on activities performed when access has been granted. See section 3.7.2.53.6.2.5
for more information.
3.6.2.33.7.2.3 AUTHENTICATION
Encompass authenticates an individual  (or integrated  system) to confirm they are whom they say they are.
Authentication  is managed using a unique  username/password combination  or by single sign-on.
Encompass supports internal and external authentication  methods, as follows:
• Internal authentication  is performed by Encompass. It establishes the validity of the user by
connecting  to the underlying  Oracle database using Oracle's authentication  method.
• External authentication  uses an application external to Encompass to establish the validity  of
a user. Encompass supports  several external authentication  methods.
Encompass also supports single sign-on if external authentication  is configured. Single sign-on allows
users to connect to Encompass without  needing to re-enter a username and password. Each Encompass
user requires a specific user id to be created in Encompass through  the Business & Administration  Studio
GUI, or alternatively via REST API. The sign-on system being used will be responsible for mapping  the
company user id to the Encompass user id. When external authentication  is in use, the enabled, locked,
and expired statuses on the Encompass user are ignored because the external system controls them.
Encompass can be configured  to use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for single sign-on,
where one set of credentials is used to log into many different websites and applications.
• Single sign-on  is where the user does not enter an Encompass username and password at all
because the system uses the user’s Window’s PC authentication credentials. This is enabled by
configuration/setup  of the Active Directory and security certificates being assigned to the
Encompass application.
• SAML provides an open, interoperable, standard approach to SSO that allows users to log in
once and access multiple different Encompass UIs, including  web browser-based ones, even
across security domains. Single sign-on  allows users to connect to Encompass without
needing to re-enter a username and password. This allows customers to reduce costs,
increase efficiency and improve security by simplifying  their user management infrastructure
by only having to manage one set of credentials per user after the initial user creation in
Encompass, rather than having to maintain several separate accounts across multiple
systems.
The following  factors determine whether authentication  is performed internally or externally:
• The user’s Encompass user profile
• Configuration  of external authentication  methods
• Configuration  of the API call.
3.6.2.3.13.7.2.3.1 PASSWORD MANAGEMENT USING INTERNAL AUTHENTICATION
Encompass can be configured  to use its internal password management functionality  to enable service
providers to reduce the risk of unauthorized  system access. This is achieved through  the enforcement of:
• Password definition  rules, i.e. allowable length,  valid format, and reuse rules.
• Password expiry periods.
• Failed login  actions, i.e. number of login attempts allowed before account lockout.

Session management, i.e. allow single or multiple  logins, auto-disconnect  of idle logins, manually logoff  an
active user and auto-logoff  after a defined timeframe.
3.6.2.3.23.7.2.3.2 PASSWORD MANAGEMENT USING EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATION
AND SINGLE SIGN-ON
Encompass can be configured  to use external authentication  to establish the validity of a user.
Encompass web clients can be configured  to use authentication  provided  by an external application  (for
example, Microsoft Windows) for single sign-on, which allows users to connect to Encompass without
entering a username and password. Single sign-on  can also be configured  as seamless; that is, the Home
page or a bookmarked  page can be displayed instead of the Encompass web client Login  page.
3.6.2.43.7.2.4 AUTHORIZATION
Encompass security defines which users have access to information and the type of access they have.
User authorization is based on profiles that define security privileges for different types of users.
Each user in Encompass is associated with  a single profile.
• The profile defines whether a user is authenticated  using an internal or external method  (see
previous subsection for more information  on authentication).
• The profile defines user access to the Encompass data and GUI screens required to carry out
the user's function.
A profile is made up of one or more of the following  four elements:
• Security groups:  Defines the database entities that the user can access.
o Data belonging  to a specific security group can only be seen by users who belong  to the
same security group.  Modifying  or deleting this data is further controlled  by access level
settings.
o A user can belong to more than one security group, one of which is the user’s primary
security group.
o When data is created then it is associated with the primary security group  of the user
that created the data.
• Form roles: Defines the menu items and forms (i.e. GUI screens) available to the user.
• Function  roles: Defines the database remote functions  that the user can access (i.e. this
controls access to the core Encompass APIs).
• Work groups: Provides a mechanism for the management of customer queries.
o A user or group  of users responsible for progressing and resolving queries is called a
work group.  A work group is similar to a security group,  in that queries are attached to a
work group  in the same way as data is attached to a security group.  To work with  a
query, the user profile must contain the work group  that has been assigned to the query.
Access levels define the level of security for the following  profile entities:
• Security groups,  restricting the operations a user can perform on data; for example, updating,
inserting,  and deleting  records, or updating  and deleting historical records.
• Form roles, restricting the kind of operations a user can perform using  a specific form (i.e.
GUI screen); for example, viewing,  inserting, updating,  and deleting records. Some forms
have form-specific operations;  for example, restricting the ability to insert future-dated
payments using the Payment Details form.

• Work groups, restricting a user's ability to view, insert, or update queries for a work group.
These terms, and their relationships are illustrated by the following  diagram:

FIGURE 6566:  ENCOMPASS SECURITY OVERVIEW

An example of the use of profiles to manage security is shown  in the following  diagram:

FIGURE 6667: USER SECURITY  PROFILE  EXAMPLE
In this example:
1) User A has permission to (using Profile A):
a) View, create, update, and delete any data assigned to security groups A and B.
b) View, create, and delete any data assigned to security groups C and D, but  not to update
them.

Page 145 of 169

2) User B and User C have permission to (using Profile B):
a) View, create, and delete any data assigned to security groups B, C, and D but not to
update them.
3) User B and User C do not have permission to view any data assigned to security group  A and,
therefore, they do not have permission to create, update, or delete.
4) Security Administrator  user has access to all four security groups,  controls the composition  of
the access levels, the profile link to the access levels and the user link to the profile.
3.6.2.4.13.7.2.4.1 SECURITY CONTROLS AT THE MENU AND ATTRIBUTE LEVEL
In addition to the ability to control access to the database records and GUI screens, as described in the
previous subsection, Encompass also supports  access controls on:
Views
A view displays information  to the user from various records. For example, the contact view displays
information  about the contact, customer account, case, issue, and action.
Records
It is possible to limit access to a specific record’s information by assigning a different security group to it.
For example, security can be applied to a specific action of type 'Follow  up Call' with a duration  greater
than 3 days and assigned to a specific user.
Attributes
It is possible to limit access at the attribute level. With this level of security, partial information  can be
protected or made available to different group  of users.
For example, given a customer record with attributes for name (e.g. John Smith), social security number
and date of birth, Encompass allows security to be applied to each data attribute i.e. different access
controls can be given to the name, social security number and date of birth.
Menu and Toolbar operations
Menu and toolbar operations  are security controlled by Encompass. An operation can be configured for
use in either Encompass’s menu or toolbar; the same security rules apply to both.
Security groups assigned to menu and toolbar operations ensure that the option  or button  is either
available to the user or hidden. If a user is assigned a profile containing  the same security group  as the
menu or toolbar operation,  they can view the operation wherever it is configured.
3.6.2.53.7.2.5 AUDITING
Auditing  in Encompass is provided in three different categories:
• Table auditing.
• Security audit messages.
• Auditing  of viewed fields in the client.
3.6.2.5.13.7.2.5.1 TABLE AUDITING
The table auditing  feature in Encompass can track changes to selected tables in the database. It collects
information  on who made changes to the specified table, when the changes were made, and what the
record being changed looked  like before the change.
Auditing  is enabled on a per table basis.

International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 146 of 169

Additional  disk storage may be required dependent  on the auditing  level required by the operator. Advice
on the disk space required can be provided on clarification of the specific level of auditing  that is required.
3.6.2.5.23.7.2.5.2 SECURITY AUDITING
Encompass can log audit messages and provide an audit trail when users access sensitive data on the
server.
Audit messages can be logged for:
• Administration  activities.
• Accessing a decrypted or masked value.
• Changes to security configuration.
• Login  attempts.
For each event that generates an audit message, information  about the following  can be recorded:
• User who initiated the event.
• Type of event.
• Date and time the event occurred.
• Success or failure of the event.
• Event affected in Encompass.
• Source IP address and port number.
• Destination IP address and port number.
3.6.2.5.33.7.2.5.3 VIEW AUDITING
View auditing  tracks when a user has viewed selected field data. The process generates events the firsttime data is displayed. Depending on the configuration,  the events can be selectively written to custom log
tables or to log files on the server.
The audit log records can identify:
• Changes made to objects or retrieval of objects.
• Date and time when changes were made.
• Users who made the changes.
3.6.2.63.7.2.6 DATA ENCRYPTION  AND MASKING
Encompass supports both  encryption  and masking of data attributes held within  the system. These
techniques may be used independently  or in concert to provide additional  data security.
3.6.2.6.13.7.2.6.1 DATA ENCRYPTION
Encrypted data attributes are stored in the Encompass database in an encrypted form and are only
decrypted for users with sufficient security privileges. For example, a customer’s PIN can be stored in
Encompass as an encrypted value and is only decrypted for authorized  users.
Data stored in an encrypted field can be encrypted using a 128, 192 or 256-bit AES encryption algorithm
with a random salt value to increase security. The data is decrypted when read from the database and
encrypted prior to writing to the database.

International, Inc. and/or its affiliates (''CSG''). All rights reserved.

Page 147 of 169

The data remains encrypted while at rest in the database and while being transmitted  to CSG front-end
systems and only  decrypted when a user with sufficient privileges accesses it.
When outputting  to log files, encrypted data is automatically masked. This ensures that encrypted data
cannot be leaked to users with  insufficient privilege.
Successful and unsuccessful attempts to view decrypted data are logged in a configurable format
including  details of who accessed the data, client details, and the IP address used by the client. The logs
can be configured  to be centrally stored external to Encompass.
3.6.2.6.23.7.2.6.2 DATA MASKING
Masked data attributes  are fully or partially hidden  from display to a user by a configurable  mask. The
default mask is a sequence of asterisks.
If an attribute is partially masked, then some of the data is visible while the rest is hidden.  Many payment
appliances include a credit card token where the last four digits match those of the actual credit card
number.   In this case, all but the last digits of the credit card token can be masked to enable Agents to
verify a credit card number via the last 4 digits.
Users will see different data depending  on their access levels:
• Full View Access – The user will see the full unmasked data. =
• Masked View Access – The user will see the data as masked by the masking function.
• No View Access – The user will see the default mask of “*******”.
It is possible for users to be granted update  and insert access, but not view access. This prevents users
from viewing data already stored in the masked fields yet still enables them to update  the value if
required.
Masked fields remain masked in output  to log files even when they are unmasked for display to the user.
This ensures that masked data cannot be accessed by users without the privilege to view the data.
Successful and unsuccessful attempts to view masked data are logged in a configurable  format including
details of who accessed the data, client details, and the IP address used by the client. The logs can be
configured  to be centrally stored external to Encompass.
3.6.2.73.7.2.7 WEB SERVICES  SECURITY
The solution  supports the following  security implementations:
• Transport level security (TLS v1.2)
• Web Services Security v1.1
3.6.2.7.13.7.2.7.1 TRANSPORT LEVEL SECURITY (TLS)
The solution  uses x509 (TLS) certificates to implement transport  level security for messages.
For web service calls (both inbound  to and outbound  from Encompass), this can be used to:
• Verify the identity  of the other party against a trust store.
• Provide a guarantee to another party that the connection  has not been tampered with

Page 148 of 169

3.6.2.7.23.7.2.7.2 WEB SERVICES SECURITY V1.1
Encompass’s Web Services Adapter supports a subset of the Web Services Security (WSS) v1.1: SOAP
Message Security standard. The WSS standard is an extension on SOAP with specifications for
implementing  message content integrity  and confidentiality.  The adapter can accept Security Tokens in the
form of Username tokens that conform to the Web Services Security UsernameToken Profile 1.1
specification.
3.6.2.7.33.7.2.7.3 OAUTH 2.0
Encompass’s Web Services Adapter supports OAUTH 2.O authentication for inbound and outbound  REST
API calls.
OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard  security protocol used to protect a large and growing  number of web
APIs and is used to connect websites to each other and powers native and mobile applications connecting
to cloud services.
Providing  OAuth 2.0 authentication  in Encompass Rest API calls allows secure integration  with other
applications when Encompass is deployed  in the cloud.
In addition,  it does not share password data, instead uses authorization  tokens to prove an identity
between consumers and service providers. Users can easily log into third-party  applications without
having to provide their password each time, and trust that their security is protected.

3.7.3 ZSCALER
3.7.3.1 ZERO TRUST PRIVATE  ACCESS (ZPA)
Zscaler ZPA (Zero Trust Private Access) is a key component of Zscaler's Zero Trust SASE (Secure Access
Service Edge) platform, offering a secure, direct, and fast way for users to access private applications. ZPA
inspects traffic for threats, enforces security policies, and provides protection  against malware, phishing,
and other cyber-attacks. ZPA is composed of 3 main components:  ZPA Public Service Edge, App Connectors
and Cloud Browser Isolation. ZPA routes an organization’s internet traffic through established micro
tunnels (M-Tunnels) from customer browser to Customer Connect/Encompass.
ZPA Service Edge is installed at Zscaler Data Centers around the world, and it is securely connected to ZPA
App Connector through  TLS 1.2. The App Connector is proposed to be installed in a CSG dedicated AWS
account separate from Encompass/CC AWS account.
3.7.3.2 REMOTE BROWSER  ISOLATION  (RBI)
Zscaler Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) is a remote Zscaler cloud browser in the user’s regular browser for
added PII security. As web traffic traverses the Zero Trust Exchange, RBI transforms web content  into a
safe stream of pixels delivered to the user. RBI allows administrators to disable clipboard function  to
prevent copying customer data to a local machine and also allows the addition  of watermarks with the
user’s ID, data, and timestamp to the user’s web screen, deterring them from taking screenshots or
copying  data from the isolated session, as it can be traced back to them.

4 INFRASTRUCTURE
4.1 INTEGRATION
4.1.1 FILE MANAGEMENT  AND FILE TRANSFERS
Most batch integration  is file based, which requires that files be transferred between systems. The
preferred file transfer solution is that the system that generates a file should be responsible for
transferring that file to other systems. However, both  inbound  and outbound  file transfers out of
Encompass are supported.
Managing file transfers out of Encompass gives the following  benefits:
• All file transfers are audited to a central audit log and can be reported on via the File Transfer
Audit report.
• Failed file transmissions are automatically retried a configurable  number of times.
• File transfers may be manually initiated, either for new files or previously failed file transfers.
• Partial/incomplete files are not processed until they are fully transmitted  and pass any
applicable checksum verifications.
4.1.1.1 SUPPORTED  PROTOCOLS
Encompass supports the following  standard file transfer protocols:
• SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).
• FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
• NFS file copy (Network File Share).
• FTPS/FTP-SSL.
Note: FTP and NFS are not supported in public cloud.
4.1.1.2 SCHEDULED/POLLED FILE LOADS
File transfers can be set up in two ways in Encompass:
• Scheduled – A task is scheduled to be run on a specific recurrence period. For inbound  file, the job
will run regardless of whether files have been transferred.
• Polled - A task will be run automatically when a file is received. This allows interfaces which do not
have a defined recurrence period to be run in an automated fashion.
Unless otherwise specified, all tasks are run in scheduled mode.
4.1.1.3 FILE VERIFICATION

To ensure the integrity  of file transfers, Encompass can generate checksum files for outbound  transfers
and verify file checksums for inbound  transfers. The following  table lists the algorithms  supported,  as well
as the Unix commands that can be used by systems receiving or sending files to Encompass to validate or
generate checksums:

4.1.1.4 FILE TRANSFER AUDITING
Encompass provides a report with file transfer audit information.  The report contains details of all
Encompass managed file transfers in and out of the system:
• File details (name, size).
• Transfer information  (protocol used for transfer).
• Schedule details (when the file was transferred, which process generated/consumed the file).
4.1.2 SOAP APIS
CSG’s intention is to replace existing APIs with Encompass APIs. When no Encompass API is available CSG
will conduct thorough analysis to evaluate whether the existing Freedom SOAP APIs can be reused or
require modifications  to align with the proposed solution. This assessment will involve reviewing the
current API functionalities,  compatibility,  and potential gaps in meeting  the new system requirements.
It is important to note that this evaluation is subject to a detailed scoping study and mutual agreement
between CSG and Freedom to ensure alignment  with project goals and technical feasibility.
4.1.3 TM FORUM  OPEN APIS
The APIs in the following  table are in alignment  to TMF Open API specifications and are currently available
for deployment  as part of CSG implementation projects. These APIs are relevant to supporting  the
integration  of the billing  platform.

Encompass inbound  adapter supports the OpenAPI Specification (version 3.0.3 of the OpenAPI
Specification.) for validating and data type conversion for requests and responses. Providing  automated
data validation  and conversion based on supplied  OpenAPI specification files will reduce the development
cost when implementing  new REST API functions.
Encompass also supports statistics gathering  capabilities for its REST adapters to simplify the diagnosis of
performance problems. Collecting statistics for the Encompass REST adapters provides operations staff a
regular snapshot  of how the adapters are performing.  This information  can be used to monitor  and tune
the performance and activity of the REST adapters.

4.1.5 STANDARD TASK  FRAMEWORK
The standard task framework is a set of Perl modules developed at Freedom Mobile that is intended  to
simplify the process of writing  batch processing tasks. It is based on an inversion of control design pattern
whereby the framework provides services such as batch processing, transaction management, multiprocessing, progress reporting  and recording of failures so the developer can gain the advantage of these
advanced capabilities without  any additional work and can instead focus on the business logic required for
their task.
Tasks written using the standard task framework receive the following  advantages with negligible  or zero
effort:
1. Batch Processing. Large jobs are often if processed as a single record per transaction and
sometimes doing  them as a single transaction also imposes a performance penalty as resources
like cache memory are exhausted by the huge size of the transaction. The compromise is to break
the job up into  reasonable size chunks which  are processed together to limit the overheads of so
many transactions whilst keeping each transaction small enough to not exhaust resources like
cache space.
2. Multi-processing.  When large tasks are broken up into  batches, it's usually possible to dispatch
different batches of work to different processes for processing. The Standard Task Framework
manages the process setup and inter-process communication  to make this relatively simple and
usually only requires providing  a parameter to tell it how many processes to start.
3. Progress reporting.  From an operational perspective, it's advantageous to know that a task is still
processing data and how quickly it is processing the data. The Standard Task Framework includes
standard mechanisms which ensure progress reporting  happens regularly, either after a
maximum amount  of time or records processed so operators know  how the task is progressing.
4. Failure recording.  Batch jobs may often have a number of records which fail processing for some
reason. It's often useful to have the list of failed records stored in a way that makes reprocessing
them later easier. The Standard Task Framework provides mechanisms to store the identifiers and
error details for failed records in a table in the database, which  may make reprocessing those
failed records easier.
5. Connection management.  The standard task framework automatically connects to the database,
or the TRE as may be required.
The Standard Task Framework that is in place at Freedom will be leveraged and be implemented  to
support  similar functionality  where possible.  To fit this framework into the new solution there may be
changes required that change the functionality  of the framework.
4.1.6 ENTERPRISE SERVICE BUS
As part of the deployment,  CSG will integrate with  the Freedom ESB (Sonic) by exposing our standard set
of Business APIs and leveraging several of the APIs already existing between Singleview implementation
and the applications proposed  within  CSG’s scope.

5 USER JOURNEYS & USE CASES
This section of the document describes the key business processes that are provided and supported by the
CSG solution for Freedom. The journeys and use cases have been structured around a standard set. The
following  business processes are considered:
1. Explore
A prospect becomes aware of the products  and services offered by Freedom and considers
purchasing,  potentially registering their interest and requesting  follow-up  communication.
2. Join / Buy
A prospect decides to proceed with a purchase, they are on-boarded as a customer, and the selected
product(s) are purchased/activated.
3. Use
A customer makes use of the service(s) that they have purchased, resulting in the processing of usage
events and the generation of usage charges.
4. Change
A customer makes changes to their personal data or to the set of services that they have previously
purchased.
5. Get Help
A customer interacts with Freedom to raise an issue and track it through  to resolution. Issue
resolution may result in a financial adjustment to a customer’s financial balance.
6. Pay
A customer makes a payment for amounts owed. This may be a customer-initiated payment,  or an
automated system payment.
7. Do Not Pay
A customer does not make a payment for amounts outstanding  within  an agreed payment period,
their account becomes delinquent,  and the overdue debt is chased.
8. Leave
A customer terminates their commercial relationship with Freedom, or Freedom terminates its
commercial relationship with  a customer.
9. Get & Stay Ready
The Get & Stay Ready journey comprises a set of activities and business processes representing onetime or periodic activities that Freedom will perform to bring products  to market, manage changes to
the product catalogue, and support the day-to-day running  of the business.
The following  sections outline the use cases within each customer journey that are supported by
Encompass. Note that in some cases 3
rd
 party integration  is required to support  the use case, in these
instances it is assumed that Freedom is responsible for providing  the third party solution and the
integration supported  by the third party. For example, the sales order use case may require a call to a third
party provisioning  system, CSG will support  the outbound  call as part of the order flow, Freedom will be
responsible for ensuring  the third  party processing flow and response to CSG.
