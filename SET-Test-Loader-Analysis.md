### Domain to Work Package Mapping Analysis

Based on the analysis of the SET Test Loader data and the existing work package structure, the following domain mappings have been identified:

#### Current Mappings Implemented:
- **Customer Domain** → Customer Information Management Implementation
- **Product Domain** → Product/Offer & Sales Portfolio Management Implementation  
- **Billing Domain** → Charging/Billing/Payments Implementation
- **Order Domain** → Order Management Implementation
- **Market & Sales Domain** → Product/Offer & Sales Portfolio Management Implementation
- **Service Domain** → Care & Assurance Implementation

#### Key Findings:
1. **Product Domain**: Total effort of 25 days (Product Model: 20d + Product Lifecycle: 5d)
   - Location in SET file: Cell B34 (Product Domain), Cell N34 (25 days total)
   - Matches to: Product/Offer & Sales Portfolio Management Implementation

2. **Customer Domain**: Total effort of 215 days (highest effort domain)
   - Includes components like Customer specific requirements (120d), Account Level Charge Distribution (20d), Volume based Charging (20d)
   - Matches to: Customer Information Management Implementation

3. **Billing Domain**: Total effort of 0 days (no Phase 1 effort allocated)
   - Components exist but no effort assigned in Phase 1 scenario
   - Matches to: Charging/Billing/Payments Implementation

4. **Order Domain**: Total effort of 0 days (no Phase 1 effort allocated)
   - Components exist but no effort assigned in Phase 1 scenario
   - Matches to: Order Management Implementation

#### Effort Distribution Summary:
- **Customer Domain**: 215 days (43% of total effort)
- **Other/Supporting**: 120 days (24% of total effort)
- **Product Domain**: 40 days (8% of total effort)
- **Remaining Domains**: 0 days (template structure)

#### Implementation Notes:
- The SET importer successfully loads domain-level effort totals
- Work package cards display both original estimates and SET-derived totals
