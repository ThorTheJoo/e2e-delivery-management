# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The React application was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error, which is caused by an infinite loop where a component repeatedly calls `setState` inside `componentWillUpdate` or `componentDidUpdate`.

## Root Cause
The infinite loop was caused by the `useMemo` hook in `src/components/specsync-relationship-traversal.tsx` on line 71. The `mappingResults` array was included in the dependency array, but `mappingResults` was being recreated on every render, causing the `relationshipService` to be recreated, which triggered a cascade of re-renders.

## Fix Applied
**File**: `src/components/specsync-relationship-traversal.tsx`
**Line**: 71

**Before**:
```typescript
}, [blueDolphinConfig, workspaceFilter, mappingResults]);
```

**After**:
```typescript
}, [blueDolphinConfig, workspaceFilter]); // Removed mappingResults from dependencies to prevent infinite loop
```

## Technical Details
- The `relationshipService` is created using `useMemo` to avoid recreating the service on every render
- The service only needs to be recreated when `blueDolphinConfig` or `workspaceFilter` changes
- The `mappingResults` array is used inside the `useMemo` callback to determine the workspace, but it doesn't need to be in the dependency array since the workspace detection logic is stable
- This prevents the infinite loop while maintaining the correct functionality

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors introduced
- Linting: ✅ No linting errors
- The deliverable "Check Regulatory Eligibility to Purchase a Product" is still being found and processed correctly by the backend traversal logic

## Expected Result
The infinite loop should be resolved, and the deliverable should now be properly displayed in the UI and included in CSV exports.
