# ADO Integration Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The "Work Items" tab in the ADO Integration component was causing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error due to an infinite loop in the `useEffect` hook.

## Root Cause
The `useEffect` hook in `src/components/ado-integration.tsx` (line 104) had dependencies `[tmfDomains, specSyncItems, blueDolphinObjects]` that were being recreated on every render, causing the effect to run repeatedly and trigger state updates, which caused re-renders, creating an infinite loop.

## Fix Applied
**File**: `src/components/ado-integration.tsx`
**Line**: 104

**Before**:
```typescript
}, [tmfDomains, specSyncItems, blueDolphinObjects]);
```

**After**:
```typescript
}, []); // Removed dependencies to prevent infinite loop - initialize only once on mount
```

## Technical Details
- The `useEffect` is used to initialize the selected domains, capabilities, requirements, and Blue Dolphin objects
- Since this is initialization logic that should only run once when the component mounts, removing the dependencies is appropriate
- The effect will now only run once on component mount, preventing the infinite loop
- The initialization logic will still work correctly as it accesses the props directly

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors introduced (unrelated error in different file)
- Linting: ✅ No linting errors
- The fix addresses the specific infinite loop that was occurring when clicking the "Work Items" tab

## Expected Result
The "Work Items" tab should now work without causing infinite loops, and the deliverable should be properly displayed in the UI and included in CSV exports.
